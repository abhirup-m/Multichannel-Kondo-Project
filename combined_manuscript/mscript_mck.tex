\section{Fixed point theory of over-screened MCK model}

\subsection{RG flows towards intermediate coupling}
\label{rg_flow_section}
We start with the usual \(K\)-channel Kondo model Hamiltonian with isotropic couplings \cite{Noz_blandin_1980}:
\begin{gather}
	\label{mc_ham}
	H = \sum_{l=1}^K H_l~,\nonumber\\
	H_l = \sum_{k}\sum_{\alpha=\uparrow,\downarrow}\epsilon_{k,l} \hat n_{k\alpha,l} + J\sum_{kk^\prime} \sum_{\alpha,\beta= \uparrow,\downarrow}\vec{S_d}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c_{k\alpha,l}^\dagger c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime, l}~.
\end{gather}
Here, \(l\) sums over the \(K\) channels of the conduction bath, \(k,k^\prime\) sum over all the momentum states of the bath and \(\alpha,\beta\) sum over the two spin indices of a single electron. \(c_{k\alpha,l}\) is the fermionic field operator at momentum \(k\), spin \(\alpha\) and channel \(l\). \(\epsilon_{k,l}\) represents the dispersion of the \(l^\text{th}\) conduction channel. \(\vec \sigma\) is the vector of Pauli matrices and \(\vec S_d = \frac{1}{2}\vec \sigma_d\) is the impurity spin operator.

We have performed a renormalisation group analysis of the Hamiltonian using the recently developed URG method \cite{anirbanmott2,anirbanmott2,anirbanurg1,anirbanurg2,siddharthacpi,santanukagome,1dhubjhep}. The RG proceeds \textit{by applying unitary transformations in order to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian by removing number fluctuations of the high energy degrees of freedom}. If the most energetic electronic state at the \(j^\text{th}\) RG step is \(\ket{j}\) defined by the energy \(D_{(j)}\), the Hamiltonian will in general not conserve the number of particles in this state: \(\left[H_{(j)}, \hat n_{j}\right] \neq 0\). The unitary transformation \(U_{(j)}\) will remove this number fluctuation at the next RG step:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	H_{(j-1)} = U_{(j)} H_{(j)} U^\dagger_{(j)}, ~\left[H_{(j-1)}, \hat n_{j}\right] =0
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The unitary transformations are given in terms of a fermionic generator \(\eta_{(j)}\):
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	U_{(j)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left(1 + \eta_{(j)} - \eta_{(j)}^\dagger\right), \quad\left\{ \eta_{(j)},\eta_{(j)}^\dagger \right\}_\pm = 1
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where \(\left\{A,B\right\}_\pm = AB \pm BA\). The generator itself is given by the expression
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\eta^\dagger_{(j)} = \frac{1}{\hat \omega_{(j)} - \text{Tr}\left(H_{(j)} \hat n_{j}\right) } c^\dagger_{j} \text{Tr}\left(H_{(j)}c_{j}\right)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The operator \(\hat \omega_{(j)}\) encodes the quantum fluctuation scales arising from the interplay of the kinetic energy terms and the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\hat \omega_{(j)} = H_{(j-1)} - H^i_{(j)}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\(H^i_{(j)}\) is that part of \(H_{(j)}\) that commutes with \(\hat n_j\) but does not commute with at least one \(\hat n_l\) for \(l < j\). The RG continues up to energy \(D^*\) where a fixed point is reached from the vanishing of either the numerator or the denominator.

The derivation of the RG equation for the over-screened regime \((2S < K)\) of the spin-\(S\)-impurity \(K\)-channel Kondo problem is shown in appendix \ref{appendix_urg}. On decoupling circular isoenergetic shells at energies \(D_{(j)}\), the change in the Kondo coupling at the \(j^\text{th}\) RG step, \(\Delta J_{(j)}\), is given by
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J_{(j)} = -\frac{J_{(j)}^2 \mathcal{N}_{(j)}}{\omega_{(j)} - \frac{D_{(j)}}{2} + \frac{J_{(j)}}{4}}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2}\rho J_{(j)} K \right) 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\(\mathcal{N}_{(j)}\) is the number of electronic states at the energy shell \(D_{(j)}\). We work in the low quantum fluctuation regime \(\omega_{(j)} < \frac{D_{(j)}}{2}\). There are three fixed points of the RG equation. One arises from the vanishing of the denominator, and was present in the single-channel Kondo RG equation as well \cite{kondo_urg}. As shown there, this fixed-point goes to \(J^* = \infty\) as the bare bandwidth of the conduction electrons is made large. The other trivial fixed point is the trivial one at \(J^* = 0\). The third fixed point is reached when the numerator vanishes: \(J^* = \frac{2}{K \rho}\) \cite{Gan_mchannel_1994,Kogan_2018,Kuramoto1998,Noz_blandin_1980}. Only the intermediate fixed point is found to be stable. This is consistent with results from Bethe ansatz calculations~\cite{Tsvelick_Weigmann_mchannel_1984,andrei_destri_1984,zarand_costi_2002,andrei_jerez_1995,Tsvelick_1985,Tsvelick1984}, CFT calculations~\cite{affleck_1991_overscreen,affleck1993exact,affleck_ludwig_1991}, bosonization treatments~\cite{emery_kivelson,vondelft_prl_1998} and NRG analysis~\cite{pang_cox_1991,mitchell_bulla_2014}.
\begin{figure}[!htpb]

	\caption{The three fixed points of the over-screened RG equation. Only the intermediate one is stable.}
	\label{rg_flow}
\end{figure}

The RG equation reduces to the perturbative form \(\Delta J_{(j)} \simeq \frac{J_{(j)}^2 \mathcal{N}_{(j)}}{D_{(j)}}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2}\rho J_{(j)} K \right)\)~\cite{Kogan_2018,Kuramoto1998,Noz_blandin_1980,tripathi2018landau} when one replaces \(\omega_{(j)}\) with the ground state energy \(-\frac{D_{(j)}}{2}\) and assumes \(J \ll D_{(j)}\).

\subsection{Star graph as the effective fixed point Hamiltonian}
The fixed point Hamiltonian takes the form
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	H^* = \sum_l\left[ \sum^*_{k}\epsilon_{k,l} \hat n_{k\alpha,l} + J\sum_{kk^\prime}^* \vec{S_d}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c_{k\alpha,l}^\dagger c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime, l}~.\right]
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
We have not explicitly written the decoupled degrees of freedom \(D_{(j)} > D^*\) in the Hamiltonian. The \(*\) over the summations indicate that only the momenta inside the window \(D^*\) enter the summation. There is an implied summation over the spin indices \(\alpha,\beta\).

To study the low energy physics and universality of the problem, we will mostly focus on the zero bandwidth limit of the fixed point Hamiltonian. Upon setting the chemical potential equal to the Fermi energy, this zero bandwidth model becomes a Heisenberg spin-exchange Hamiltonian.
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{stargraph}
	H^* = J\sum_l\sum_{kk^\prime}^* \vec{S_d}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c_{k\alpha,l}^\dagger c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime, l} = J\vec{S_d}\cdot\sum_l \vec{s}_l~.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
At the last step, we defined the local spin operator \(\vec{s}_l = \frac{1}{2}\sigma_l = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{kk^\prime}^*\sum_{\alpha\beta}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c_{k\alpha,l}^\dagger c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime, l}\) of each conduction channel.
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./stargraph.pdf}
	\caption{Zero bandwidth limit of the fixed point Hamiltonian. The central yellow node is the impurity spin, and it is interacting with the local spins of the channels represented as outer green nodes, through a Heisenberg spin-exchange coupling.}
	\label{stargraph_fig}
\end{figure}
The star graph commutes with several operators, including the total spin operator \(J^z = S_d^z + \sum_l s_l^z\) along \(z\), the total bath local spin operator \(s^2_\text{tot} = \left(\sum_l \vec s_l\right)^2\) and the string operators 
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\pi^{x,y,z} = \sigma_d^{x,y,z} \otimes_{l=1}^K \sigma_l^{x,y,z}~.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The \(\pi^z\) acts on the eigenstates \(\ket{J^z}\) and reveals the odd-even parity of the eigenvalue \(J^z\), and is hence a parity operator. Interestingly, \textit{the string operator \(\pi^z\) is a Wilson loop operator~\cite{fradkin2013field} that wraps around all the nodes of the star graph}:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{w_loop}
	\pi^z = \exp\left[i \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\sigma_d^z + \sum_{l=1}^K \sigma^z_l - K\right)\right] = e^{i \pi \left(J^z - \frac{1}{2}K\right)}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\(\pi^x\) and \(\pi^y\) mix states of opposite parity. For example, it can be shown that \(\pi^x \ket{J^z} = -\ket{J^z}\). These are 't Hooft operators \cite{fradkin2013field}.


There are multiple reasons for working with the star graph in particular and zero mode Hamiltonians in general. In the single-channel Kondo model, the star graph is just the two spin Heisenberg, and it reveals the stabilization of the Kondo model ground state, as well as certain thermodynamic properties (e.g., the impurity contribution to the susceptibility)~\cite{varma_yafet_1976,yosida_1966,wilson1975renormalization,moca_zarand_2021,varma_yafet_1976,kondo_urg}. Similarly in the MCK model, the star graph is able to mimic the nature of the RG flows: At weak coupling \(J \to 0^+\), the central spin is weakly coupled to the outer spins and  prone to screening because of the \(s^\pm\) terms in the star graph, and at strong coupling \(J \to \infty^-\), the outer spin-half objects tightly bind with the central spin-half object to form a single spin object that interacts with the remaining states through an exchange coupling which is RG relevant, rendering both the terminal fixed points unstable. The true stable fixed point must then lie somewhere in between, and we recover the schematic phase diagram of fig.~\ref{rg_flow}. 

The utility of the star graph is due to the fact that \textit{the non-Fermi liquid arises solely from the degeneracy of the ground state manifold of the underlying zero mode Hamiltonian, and the star graph captures this degeneracy in its entirety}. The RG flows of the MCK model have been show to \textit{preserve the degeneracy of the ground state}~\cite{pang_cox_1991,kroha_kolf_2007,zitko_fabrizio_2017}\textcolor{red}. The star graph conserves the total spin \(J^z\), and this leads to a ground state degeneracy of \(|\frac{K}{2}-S|+1\) in the \(K-\)channel spin-\(S\) star graph which is preserved under the RG flow. This is qualitatively different from the case of the single-channel Kondo model where the \(2-\)fold degeneracy of the local moment fixed point crosses over into a stable and unique singlet ground state. 

As we will see in a subsequent section, the lowest excitations of the intermediate fixed point is described a non-Fermi liquid phase induced by nearest-neighbour hopping terms between the zeroth sites and the first sites of the conduction channels. The importance of the degeneracy can be shown in the following manner. As mentioned previously, the ground state degeneracy of the more general star graph with a spin-\(S\) impurity and \(K\) channels is given by \(g^S_K = |K - 2S|+1\). The cases of \(K=2S\), \(K<2S\) and \(K>2S\) correspond to exactly screened, under-screened and over-screened regimes respectively. \textit{The latter two cases correspond to a multiply-degenerate manifold \(g^S_K > 1\), and simultaneously have non-Fermi liquid phases~\cite{Noz_blandin_1980,Gan_Andrei_Coleman_1993,emery_kivelson,Gan_mchannel_1994,Tsvelick_Weigmann_mchannel_1984,Tsvelick_weigmann_mchannel_1985,parcollet_olivier_large_N,kimura_taro_Su_N_kondo,PhysRevB.73.224445,cox_jarrell_two_channel_rev,affleck_1991_overscreen,Coleman_tsvelik,affleck1993exact,coleman_pepin_2003,roch_nicolas_costi_2009,schiller_avraham_2008,Durganandini_2011}, while the first regime has a unique ground state \(g^S_K = 1\) and is described by a local Fermi liquid (LFL) phase \cite{wilson1975,nozieres1974fermi,Noz_blandin_1980,andreiKondoreview,tsvelickKondoreview}, thereby substantiating the claim that a degeneracy greater than unity leads to non-Fermi liquid physics.} In the following sections, we will show how the inherent quantum-mechanical frustration of singlet order that is present in the Hamiltonian leads to the degenerate ground state manifold and the non-trivial physics of the fixed points in terms of non-Fermi liquid phase, diverging thermodynamic quantities, quantum criticality as well as emergent gauge theories.

\section{Important Properties of the Star Graph}
\subsection{Hamiltonian and wavefunctions}
\noindent As shown in the previous section, at the heart of multi-channel Kondo there is a star graph problem which is the zero mode of the low energy fixed point Hamiltonian of the Multi channel Kondo. In this section our focus will be on the star graph problem itself.
% \begin{figure}[!ht]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/stargraph_first}
% \caption{This is a star graph model with one central spin $\vec{S}_d$ and $K$ outer spin $1/2$s. The central spin is coupled with all the outer spins with Heisenberg coupling with coupling strength $\alpha$.}
% \label{fig:stargraph_first}
% \end{figure}
As shown in the Fig.\ref{stargraph_fig} above, one central spin ($\vec{S}_d$) is connected with $K$ spins forming a $K$ channel star graph problem corresponding to the $K$-channel Kondo problem. The Hamiltonian of this above model is given as 
\begin{eqnarray}
H &=& \alpha \vec{S}_d.\sum_{i=1}^{K}\vec{S}_i=\alpha \vec{S}_d.\vec{S} \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\alpha}{2} (\vec{J}^2-\vec{S}^2-\vec{S}_d^2)~,~~\alpha >0.
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{J}=\vec{S}+\vec{S}_d$ and $\vec{S}=\sum_{i=1}^{K} \vec{S}_i$. One can see that the large psin $S$ can take many possible values as this is made out of $K$ spin 1/2s. We can see $[H,J]=0=[H,J^i]$ for  $i=x,y,z$, $[J^i,J^j]\neq 0$ for $i\neq j$. Also the operators $\hat{Z}=2^{K+1}S_d^z\prod_{i=1}^{K} S_i^z $ and $\hat{X}=2^{K+1}S_d^x\prod_{i=1}^{K} S_i^x $ commutes with the Hamiltonian, $[H,\hat{Z}]=0=[H,\hat{X}]$ though $[\hat{Z},\hat{X}]\neq 0$, in general.
 Thus we can form the CSCO with $H,J,J^z,S,S_d$. For a particular value $S$, $J$ can take two values $S\pm S_d$ with the energies $-\alpha S_d(S_d+1\mp J)$ respectively. $S_d$ is fixed thus the energy values only depends on the corresponding $J$ value of the state. As the energy does not depends on the $J^z$, all $2J+1$ $J^z$ states labeled by $|S_d,S;J,J^z\rangle$ are degenerate. It is easy to see that the ground state has energy $E=-\alpha S_d(S_d+1+J)$ with  $J=S-S_d$, thus $E_g=-\alpha S_d(S_{max}+1)$ with $S$ taking the maximum possible value $S_{max}=K/2$.


\subsubsection{Ground state wavefunction}
\noindent Above calculations show star graph with $K$ channels has $K$-fold ground state degeneracy, states labeled as $|S_d,S;J,J^z\rangle$ where $J^z$ takes $K=2J+1$ distinct values, $J^z=\{-J,\cdots,+J \}$. Here our goal is to find the wavefunction in the fundamental spin basis $|S_d^z,S_1^z,\cdots,S_K^z\rangle$. To achieve that we use the Clebsch-gordon coefficients, we know for two spins $j_1$ and $j_2$  with total spin $J$ and $J^z=M$ one can expand the state as 
\begin{eqnarray}
|j_1,j_2;J,M\rangle &=& \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{m_1=\{-j_1,\cdots,j_1\} \\ m_2=\{-j_2,\cdots,j_2\} }}   \mathcal{C}^{j_1,m_1;j_2,m_2}_{j_1,j_2;J,M} |j_1,m_1;j_2,m_2 \rangle ,~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where $j_1^z=m_1$ and $j_2^z=m_2$ and $\mathcal{C}^{j_1,m_1;j_2,m_2}_{j_1,j_2;J,M}$ is the Clebs-Gordon coefficient. In our problem two spins $S_d$ and $S$ are forming one large spin $J$ represented by the state $|S_d,S;J,J^z\rangle$, in the ground state $J=S-1/2$. Thus the ground state $|S_d,S; (S-\frac{1}{2} ),M\rangle \equiv |\alpha\rangle$ can be expanded as
%{%\tiny
\begin{eqnarray}
%&&\bigg|S_d,S;\bigg(S-\frac{1}{2}\bigg),M\bigg\rangle = ww\\
&&|\alpha\rangle= \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{m_1=\{-S_d,\cdots,S_d\} \\ m_2=\{-S,\cdots,S\} }} \mathcal{C}^{S_d,m_1;S,m_2}_{S_d,S;J,M} ~~   | S_d,m_1 \rangle \otimes  |S,m_2  \rangle ,~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
%}
Because in the ground state $S$ is maximum, the state $|S,S^z\rangle$ can be decomposed in terms of a two spin problem of spin $1/2$ and $S-1/2$ forming the state $|1/2,S-1/2;S,S^z\rangle$ which can be further expanded in the basis $ |1/2,m'_1 \rangle \otimes  |S-1/2,m'_2  \rangle $ where $m'_1,m'_2$ are the z-components of the spin $1/2$ and $S-1/2$. Next we decompose the state $|S-1/2,m'_2\rangle$ in further smaller spin problem and so on. This way we finally arrive at the ground state wavefunction in terms of the fundamental basis $|S_d^z,S_1^z,\cdots,S_K^z\rangle$, give as
\begin{eqnarray}
|S_d,S;J,M\rangle &=& \sum_{S_d^z,\{S_i^z\}} \mathcal{D}_{S_d^z,\{S_i^z\}} |S_d^z,S_1^z,\cdots,S_K^z\rangle
\end{eqnarray}
where $\{S_i^z\}\equiv(S_1^z,\cdots,S_K^z)$ and the coefficient $\mathcal{D}_{S_d^z,\{S_i^z\}}$ is given as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{D}_{S_d^z,\{S_i^z\}}  &=& \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{m_2=[-S,S]\\ m_4=[-(S-1/2),(S-1/2)]\\~.~\\  m_{2N-4}=[-1,1]   }} \mathcal{M}^{S_d^z,S_1^z,~.~.~ ,S_K^z}_{m_2,m_4,~.~.~ ,m_{2N-2}}~,~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
and further the coefficients $\mathcal{M}^{S_d^z,S_1^z,~.~.~ ,S_K^z}_{m_2,m_4,~.~.~, m_{2N-2}} \equiv\Sigma$, are made out of the products of Clebsh-Gordon Coefficients
\begin{eqnarray}
%\mathcal{M}^{\{m^{(1)}\}}_{\{m^{(2)}\}} &=& 
\Sigma=\mathcal{C}^{S_d,S_d^z;S,m_2}_{S_d,S;J,M} ~~ \mathcal{C}^{S_1,S_1^z;(S-1/2),m_4}_{S_1,(S-1/2);S,m_2} \cdots  \mathcal{C}^{S_{K-1},S_{K-1}^z;S_K,S_K^z}_{S_{K-1},S_{K};1,m_{2N-4}}~,~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
Using these wavefunctions we can calculate various entanglement features of this star graph problem.


\subsection{Entanglement properties}
\noindent Using the above exact wavefunctions we can numerically compute various entanglement properties of this star graph model. 

\subsubsection{Impurity entanglement entropy}
\noindent Here we are interested in finding the entanglement of the central impurity spin with the rest of the multi-channel bath zero mode. We know that for multi-channel case the ground state is degenerate, thus for each degenerate state we can calculate the entanglement entropy. As we have already discussed for $N_{ch}$ number of channels there are $N_{ch}$ number of degenerate ground states, labeled by the $J_z$ quantum number.\\
\par For single channel case the the ground state is unique and is 
\begin{eqnarray}
|J=0,J_z=0 \rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow_{d}\downarrow_0\rangle -|\downarrow_d \uparrow_0\rangle)
\end{eqnarray}
Thus, one can easily calculate the reduced density matrix of the impurity by tracing out the $0^{th}$ state. From that reduced denisty matrix the entanglement entropy is $\log 2$, which is maximum possible for a spin-1/2.
\par Next, we are interested in findig this entanglement entropy for the multi-channel case $N_{ch}>1$. We have generated the degenerate ground states analytically using the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. On this wavefunctions we do various entanglement and correlation studies. We start with the ground state wavefunction, $|\psi_g\rangle_{J_z}=|1/2_{d},S;J,J_z\rangle$, starting with one of those degenerate ground states labeled by $J_z$ we calculate the density matrix.
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_{J_z}=|\psi_g\rangle_{J_z} \langle\psi_g|_{J_z}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/EE_multi_channel_ANN.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/outer_EE_multi_channel_ANN.png}
\caption{Y-axis shows the impurity entanglement entropy with the rest and X-axis shows the number of channels $N_{ch}$. For one value of $N_{ch}>1$, there are $N_{ch}$ degenerate ground states and their corresponding impurity entanglement entropy. }
\end{figure}

\noindent Using the wavefunction we can do the partial tracing on the impurity spin to get the reduced denisty matrix of the rest. From that we get entanglement entropy for different number of channels. For even number of channel cases $J_z$ and $-J_z$ sector has same entanglement entropy. For the case of odd $N_{ch}$ there also $\pm J_z$ sectors shares same entanglement entropy, but there is a state $J_z=0$ which has entanglement entropy $\log 2$. Thus from the above we can see that $J_z=0$ state corresponding to odd number of channels shows perfect screenig interms of the maximum entanglement entropy and $J_z=0$ magnetization.


\subsubsection{Mutual Information}

Mutual information between two sub-systems $A, B$ is defined as, 
\begin{eqnarray}
I^2(A:B)=S_A+S_B-S_{A\cup B}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/I_2_vs_Nch_0_1}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/I_2_vs_Nch_1_2}
\caption{\textit{Left:} Y-axis is the mutual information between the impurity-spin and one outer spin and x-axis is the number of channel $N_{ch}$. \textit{Right:} This shows the variation of mutual information between two outer spins.}
\label{fig:MI_vs_Nch}
\end{figure}

We first study the mutual information between the impurity-spin and one outer spin $I^2(d:o)$. Because all the outer spins are symmetric, the mutual information between impurity-spin with any one outer spin is same. Next we calculate the mutual information between two outer spin $I^2(o:o)$. One can see that the maximum mutual information for both the cases are from the $(J_z)_{min}$ state. For odd number of channels $(J_z)_{min}=0$ and for even number of channels $\pm (J_z)_{min}=\pm 1/2$. And the minimum mutual information corresponds to the $\pm (J_z)_{max}=\pm J$ state.\\

\par As can be seen from the above Figure.\ref{fig:MI_vs_Nch} that  both the maximum mutual information of $I^2(d:o)$ and $I^2(o:o)$ try to saturate near the same value. Thus in the lowest $J_z$ sector the entanglement distribution between impurity and outer vs outer and outer is same. Which suggests that even though there were no coupling among the outer spins explicitly, there are entanglement among them. The minimum of the mutual information coming from the largest $J_z$ sector, the $I^2(o:o)$ corresponding to this sector asymptotically approach zero for large $N_{ch}$ limit. Which shows that in the large channel limit $N_{ch}\gg 1$ though the $min~I^2(o:o)$ pparoach zero the $min~ I^2(d:o)$ 

\subsubsection{Tripartite information}
\noindent Apart from Mutual information we can calculate the tripartite information also. This tripartite information is defined among three sub-systems $A,B,C$ , as 

\begin{eqnarray}
I^3_{A,B,C} &=& (S_A+S_B+S_C)-(S_{AB}+S_{BC}+S_{CA})+S_{ABC}~,
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\hspace*{-15pt}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/I_3_vs_Nch_1_2_3}
%\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/I_4_vs_Nch_1_2_3_4}
\caption{This plot shows the variation of the tripartite information with the number of channels $N_{ch}$.}
\label{fig:I3_vs_Nch}
\end{figure}
\noindent Our tripartite information measure (Fig.\ref{fig:I3_vs_Nch}) among the outer spins shows that the just like the mutual information the minimum tripartite information asymptotically approaches zero in the $N_{ch}\gg 1$ limit. Same is the case for 4-partite information also.

\subsubsection{$I_N$ vs N}
\noindent Here we are intersted in understading the entanglement dristribution among different number of outter spins. To find that out we take a multi-channel star graph model with $N_{ch}$ noumber of outer spins. We calculate different multi partite inforamtions $I^m, m\in \{2,\cdots,N_{ch}\}$ on it's $N_{ch}$ degenerate ground states. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/I_N_vs_N_N9.png}
\caption{This figure shows how the $m-partite$ information varies with $m$ showing the entanglement distribution amond different number of outer-spins.}

\noindent Our above study (Fig.\ref{fig:Im_vs_m}) shows that the mutual imformation has the maximum value and higher odere multi-parite informations is smaller and smaller approaching zero.

\subsection{Correlation Studies}

\subsubsection{Quantum energy}
\noindent Here we are interested in the energy expectation value arising from the quantum fluctuation part of the Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:zero_mode}). We define Ising energy $E_{ising}$ and quantum energy $E_{Q}$ in the ground state $|\psi_g\rangle$ as,
\begin{gather}
	E_{ising} = |\langle \psi_g | \mathcal{H}^c_0 | \psi_g \rangle| \\
E_{Q} = |\langle \psi_g | \mathcal{H}^Q_0 | \psi_g \rangle|=|E_g|-|E_{ising}| = \frac{\alpha(S+1)}{2} - |E_{ising}|~.
\end{gather}  
This quantum energy $E_Q$ is generated by the spin-flips between the impurity spin and the outer spin. Thus it is interesting to findout how this quantum energy changes with the increase of the number of channels $(N_{ch})$. Another important parameter is the Quantum enrgy per channel, $e_Q=|E_Q|/N_{ch}$, and it's variation towards the infinity channel limit. We know in the gorund state $N_{ch}=2S$ thus,
\begin{eqnarray}
e_Q &=& \frac{\alpha(S+1)}{4S} - \frac{|E_{ising}|}{2S} ~,~\nonumber\\
%&=& \alpha\frac{(N_{ch}+2)}{4N_{ch}}-\frac{|E_{ising}|}{N_{ch}} ~,~ \nonumber\\
%&=& \alpha \bigg(\frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{2N_{ch}} \bigg)-\frac{|E_{ising}|}{N_{ch}}~,~\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\alpha}{4} -\frac{1}{N_{ch}} \bigg(|E_{ising}| -\frac{\alpha}{2}  \bigg)~,~
\end{eqnarray}
Thus from the above equation of quantum energy per channel one can see that in the inifinity-channel limit $N_{ch}\rightarrow \infty$, 

\begin{eqnarray}
e_Q = \frac{\alpha}{4}- \frac{|E_{ising}|}{N_{ch}} < \frac{\alpha}{4}~,~
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/Quantum_Energy_per_channel}
\caption{This shows the variation of quantum energy per channel with $1/N$, where $N=N_{ch}+1$ is the total number of spins in the systems including the impurity spins. }
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Correlation study}
Here we want to calculate various correlation functions in the ground state. We start with the expectation value of $J_z^2$ in the ground state $|\psi_g\rangle$,
\begin{eqnarray}
j_z^2&=&\frac{1}{N_{ch}}\langle \psi_g | J_z^2 | \psi_g \rangle~=\frac{1}{N_{ch}} \bigg[ J^2-(J_x^2+J_y^2) \bigg] ~,\nonumber\\
%&=& \frac{1}{N_{ch}} \bigg[ (S^2-1/4)-(J_x^2+J_y^2) \bigg] \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{1}{N_{ch}} \bigg[ \frac{(N_{ch}^2-1)}{4}-(J_x^2+J_y^2) \bigg]
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\langle \psi_g | J_{z}^2 | \psi_g \rangle_{max} &=& \bigg(\frac{N_{ch}-1}{2}\bigg)^2~,\nonumber\\
\langle \psi_g | J_{z}^2 | \psi_g \rangle_{min} = \bigg(\frac{N_{ch}-(N_{ch}-1)}{2}\bigg)^2&=&\frac{1}{4}~,~\textrm{for $N_{ch}$ even}.\nonumber\\
&=& 0 ~,~\textrm{for $N_{ch}$ odd}.
\end{eqnarray}
Thus,
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle (J_x)^2+(J_y)^2 \rangle_{max}&=&\langle J^2 \rangle - \langle J_z^2 \rangle_{min} ~,\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{N_{ch}^2-1}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{N_{ch}^2-2}{4}~, \textrm{for $N_{ch}$ even } \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{N_{ch}^2-1}{4}~, \textrm{for $N_{ch}$ odd } \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Which shows, for single channel case $N_{ch}=1$, this quntum fluctuation expectation value vanishes, while for multi-channel this takes non-zero values. Thus 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{N_{ch}}\langle (J_x)^2+(J_y)^2 \rangle_{max}
&=& \frac{N_{ch}}{4}-\frac{1}{2N_{ch}}  ~, \textrm{for $N_{ch}$ even } \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{N_{ch}}{4}-\frac{1}{4N_{ch}}~, \textrm{for $N_{ch}$ odd } \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Thus in the large channel number limit $N_{ch}\gg 1$, one can see that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{N_{ch}}\langle (J_x)^2+(J_y)^2 \rangle_{max}
\rightarrow \frac{N_{ch}}{4}~,~\textrm{for both even and odd $N_{ch}$}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent $J_z$ can take values $\{-J,-J+1,\cdots,J-1,J\}$ in the ground state, where $J=S-1/2=(N_{ch}-1)/2$.




\subsubsection{Staggerred magnetization}
One can analytically check the single channel Kondo results. $N_{ch}=1$, thus here the ground state is unique.
\begin{eqnarray}
|\psi_g\rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle-|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle\bigg)= |J=0,J_z=0\rangle
\end{eqnarray}
Thus in this ground state $\langle J_z \rangle=0$ and the  entanglement entropy is $\log 2$ the maximum value. Now we define a staggered magnetization (\ref{fig:st_mag}) operator $M_s$ measure,


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/Staggered_mag_50.png}
\caption{This shows how the staggered magnetization changes with the number of channels $N_{ch}$.}
\label{fig:st_mag}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For the single channel case both the $\vec{S}_d$ and $\vec{S}$ are spin-1/2 object and the total spin is defined as $\vec{J}=\vec{S}_d+\vec{S}$. Here $\vec{S}$ is the total outer spin.

\begin{eqnarray}
M_s^2 = \langle \psi_g | (\vec{S}_d - \vec{S})^2 |\psi_g\rangle &=& \langle \psi_g | 2(\vec{S}_d^2 + \vec{S}^2)-\vec{J}^2 |\psi_g\rangle \nonumber\\
&=& 2 \langle \psi_g | \vec{S}_d^2 +\vec{S}^2 |\psi_g\rangle \nonumber\\
&=& 3
\end{eqnarray}

\item \begin{eqnarray}
M_s^2 &=& \langle \psi_g | (\vec{S}_d - \vec{S})^2 |\psi_g\rangle = \langle \psi_g | 2(\vec{S}_d^2 + \vec{S}^2)-\vec{J}^2 |\psi_g\rangle \nonumber\\
&=&  \bigg\langle \psi_g \bigg| 2\bigg(\frac{3}{4}+ \frac{N_{ch}(N_{ch}+2)}{4}\bigg)- \frac{(N_{ch}+1)(N_{ch}-1)}{4} \bigg|\psi_g \bigg\rangle \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{N_{ch}^2}{4}+N_{ch}+\frac{7}{4}
\end{eqnarray}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Thus, staggered magnetization squared per channel,
\begin{eqnarray}
m_s^2=\frac{M_s^2}{N_{ch}^2}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{N_{ch}}+\frac{7}{4N_{ch}^2} \xrightarrow[]{N_{ch}\gg 1} \frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{N_{ch}}~,
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\vec{J}^2}{N_{ch}^2}&=&\frac{(\vec{S}_d+\vec{S})^2}{N_{ch}^2}= \frac{N^2_{ch}-1}{4N^2_{ch}} \xrightarrow[]{N_{ch}\gg 1} \frac{1}{4}~. \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

Using the $SU(2)$ property of our problem, we can define $m_s$ for each spatial direction, in 3D there are three independent spatial direction.
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle(m_s^x)^2\rangle=\langle(m_s^y)^2\rangle=\langle(m_s^z)^2\rangle=\frac{1}{3}m_s^2~,~~   
\end{eqnarray}
We define $m_Q^2=m_s^2-1/4$ which in the the large $N_{ch}$ limit becomes $1/N_{ch}$ and eventually vanishes in the $N_{ch}\rightarrow \infty$ limit. 


\noindent Thus to summarize,
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the single channel problem, $\langle (m_s^z)^2 \rangle=1$. 
\item In the multi-channel case,  
$\langle (m_s^z)^2 \rangle=\frac{1}{3N_{ch}}+\frac{1}{12}+\frac{7}{12N_{ch}^2} \xrightarrow[]{N_{ch}\gg 1} \frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{3N_{ch}}\rightarrow \frac{1}{12}$. 
This show partial screening.
\end{enumerate}

Thus it is important to find the scaling of 

\begin{enumerate}
\item $M_s^2$ vs $N_{ch}$.
\item Uncompensated Quantum Fluctuation vs $N_{ch}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Thermal entropy}
% \subsubsection{Thermal entropy}
We take the star graph Hamiltonian and do the exact diagonalization and find the entire eigenspectrum. Using the full eigenspectrum we calculate the partition function $Z=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}$, where $E_i$ is the energy of the $i^{th}$ state. One can rewrite this partition function in terms of the state degeneracies as $Z=\sum_{\epsilon} d(\epsilon) e^{-\beta \epsilon} $, where $d(\epsilon)$ is the degeneracy of the state with energy $\epsilon$. Thus the free energy is given as $\mathcal{F}=-k_BT\log Z$. 

Thermal entropy is defined as $S=-(\frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial T})_H$, where $H$ represents a constant magnetic field. In ourcase we will be interested in the zero field case. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{F}&=& -k_B T\log Z \nonumber\\
S &=& -(\frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial T}) = -k_B \log Z -k_B T \frac{1}{Z} \frac{dZ}{dT}
\end{eqnarray}
Now 
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
Z &=\sum_\epsilon  d(\epsilon)e^{-\beta \epsilon}\\
\implies \frac{dZ}{dT} &= \sum_\epsilon d(\epsilon) e^{-\beta \epsilon}  (-\epsilon) \frac{d\beta}{dT} = \sum_\epsilon d(\epsilon) e^{-\beta \epsilon}   \frac{ \epsilon}{k_B T^2}\\
		       &=k_B\sum_\epsilon \epsilon d(\epsilon) e^{-\beta \epsilon} \beta^2   
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Thus we get
\begin{eqnarray}
S &=& -k_B \log \sum_{\epsilon} d(\epsilon) e^{-\beta \epsilon}  -\frac{1}{\beta} \frac{k_B\sum_\epsilon \epsilon d(\epsilon) e^{-\beta \epsilon} \beta^2   }{\sum_\epsilon  d(\epsilon)e^{-\beta \epsilon}} \nonumber\\
\lim_{\beta\rightarrow \infty} S &=& -k_B \log_2 d(\epsilon_{G})  ~~, \textrm{and}~~ \lim_{\beta\rightarrow 0} S = -k_B \log \sum_\epsilon d(\epsilon) 
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/ThermalEntanglementVS_LogTemperature_}
\caption{This shows the variation of thermal entropy with the temperature.}
\label{fig:thermal_entropy}
\end{figure}

Thus at the extreme temperature it is easy to calculate the thermal entropy, but it is difficult to visualize for any intermediate temperatures. Thus we plot the thermal entropy (unit $\log 2$) for different temperatures and for different channels in Fig.\ref{fig:thermal_entropy}. This shows at the extreme temperature the thermal entropy saturates and at the intermediate temperature it changes from one to the other like a soliton like solution. At low temperature the thermal entropy in the unit of $\log 2$ is not always quantized but at high temperature it is. To understand this let's say at low temperature $S_T/k_B\log T=\Omega=\log_2 d(\epsilon_{G})$. Here $d(\epsilon_{G})$ is always integer and equal to the channel number $K$. Thus 
\begin{eqnarray}
d(\epsilon_{G}) &=& 2^{\Omega}=K
\end{eqnarray}
From our study we can see that for some channel number we get $S_T/k_B\log T$ to be integer. One can easily see that those $K=2^n$ channel cases, $n$ is an integer will have integer thermal entropy. Thus between $m$ and $m+1$ integer thermal entropy plateau there will be $(2^m-1)$ number of fractional thermal entropy plateau, which is always odd.

\subsection{Degree of compensation: a measure of the frustration}
One can quantify the amount of screening of the local moment at the impurity site by defining a degree of compensation \(\kappa\). Such a quantity also measures the inherent singlet frustration in the problem: the higher the degree of compensation, the better the spin can be screened into a singlet and lower is the frustration. It is given by the antiferromagnetic correlation existing between the impurity spin and conduction electron channels:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Gamma \equiv - \left< \vec{S_d}\cdot \vec{s}_\text{tot}\right>
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where \(\vec s_\text{tot} = \sum_l \vec s_l\). The expectation value is calculated in the ground state. Since the inner product is simply the ground state energy of a spin-\(S\) impurity \(K-\)channel MCK model in units of the exchange coupling \(J\), we have
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Gamma = \frac{1}{2} \left[ l_\text{imp}^2 + l_c^2 - g^S_K\left( g^S_K - 1 \right)\right]
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\(l_\text{imp}^2 = S(S+1)\) is the length-squared of the impurity spin. Similarly, \(l_c^2 = \frac{K}{2}\left(\frac{K}{2} + 1\right) \) is the length-squared of the total conduction bath spin. \(g^S_K = |\frac{K}{2} - S| + 1\) is the ground state degeneracy. We will explore the three regimes of screening by defining \(K = K_0 + \delta, S = \frac{K_0}{2} - \delta\). \(\delta=0\) represents the exactly-screened case of \(K = 2S = K_0\). Non-zero \(\delta\) represents either over- or under-screening. In terms of \(K_0\) and \(\delta\), the degree of compensation becomes
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{gamma}
	\Gamma = \frac{1}{4}\left[\left( K_0 + 1 \right) ^2 - \left(|\delta| + 1 \right) ^2\right] 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\textit{For a given \(K_0\), the degree of compensation is maximised for exact screening \(\delta=0\), and is reduced for \(\delta \neq 0\). This shows the inability of the system to form a unique singlet ground state and reveals the quantum-mechanical frustration inherent in the zero mode Hamiltonian and therefore in the entire problem.} The degree of compensation is symmetric under the Hamiltonian transformation \(\delta \to -\delta\), and this represents a duality transformation between over-screened and under-screened MCK models. This topic will be discussed in more detail later.
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{../numerics/deg_of_comp.pdf}
	\caption{Variation of the degree of compensation as we tune the system from under-screening to over-screening. The maximum spin compensation occurs at exact-screening \(\delta=0\).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Impurity magnetization and susceptibility: Quantum criticality of overscreened MCK model}
The channel isotropic MCK model is critical; any perturbation away from the perfectly symmetric model in terms of anisotropy is relevant, as shown in section \ref{anisotropic_rg}~\cite{vojta_2006,andrew_bulla_2011,pang_cox_1991}. This critical nature leads to several signatures that can be obtained directly from the star graph. These signatures include a discontinuity in the impurity magnetization at zero temperature in the limit of the external field going to zero, and a diverging susceptibility as temperature goes to zero.

We insert a magnetic field that acts only on the impurity and then diagonalize the Hamiltonian.
\begin{align}
	\label{stargraph_field_hamiltonian}
	H(h) = J^* \vec{S_d}\cdot\vec{s}_\text{tot} + h S_d^z
\end{align}
The Hamiltonian commutes with \(s_\text{tot}\), so it is already block-diagonal in terms of the eigenvalues \(M\) of \(s_\text{tot}\). \(M\) takes values in the range \(\left[M_\text{min}, M_\text{max}\right]\), where \(M_\text{max} = K/2\) for a \(K-\)channel Kondo model, and \(M_\text{min} = 0\)  if \(K\) is even, otherwise \(\frac{1}{2}\). Within each block, the Hamiltonian splits into independent \(2\times 2\) blocks characterized by eigenvalues of the total spin operator \(J^z = S_d^z + s^z_\text{tot}\). Defining \(\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\left(Jm + h\right) + \frac{J}{4}\) and \(x^M_m = M(M+1) - m(m+1)\), the partition function can be written as
\begin{align}
	Z(h) =\sum_{M=M_\text{min}}^{M_\text{max}}r^K_M\left[\sum_{m=-M, \atop{m\in \mathbb{Z}}}^{M-1}2e^{\beta \frac{J}{4}}\cosh \beta\sqrt{J^2x^M_m/4 + \alpha^2} \right.\nonumber\\
\left.+ 2e^{-\beta JM/2}\cosh \beta h/2\right]
\end{align}
Here, \(\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}\), \(M\) sums over the eigenvalues of \(s_\text{tot}\) while \(m\) sums over \(J^z - \frac{1}{2}\) and the additional degeneracy factor \(r^K_M\) arises from the possibility that there are multiple subspaces defined by \(s_\text{tot}=M\). This multiplicity is given by
\begin{align}
	\label{extra_degen}
	r^K_M = {}^{K-1}C_{K/2 - M}
\end{align}

To calculate the impurity magnetic susceptibility, we will use the expression
\begin{align}
	\chi = \frac{1}{\beta}\lim_{h \to 0}\left[\frac{Z(h)^{\prime\prime}}{Z(h)} - \left(\frac{Z(h)^{\prime}}{Z(h)}\right)^2 \right] 
\end{align}
where the \(\prime\) indicates derivative with respect to \(h\). For brevity, we define \(\theta_M = \beta J (M+\frac{1}{2})/2\) and \(\Sigma_M = \sum_{m=-M, \atop{m\in \mathbb{Z}}}^{M-1}(m+\frac{1}{2})^2\). The derivatives are
\begin{align}
	\lim_{h \to 0}Z(h) &= \sum_{M=M_\text{min}}^{M_\text{max}}r^K_M\left[4Me^{\beta \frac{J}{4}}\cosh \theta_M + 2e^{-\beta JM/2}\right]\\
	\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\:\mathrm{d}Z(h)}{\:\mathrm{d}h} &=  0\\
	\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\:\mathrm{d}^2Z(h)}{\:\mathrm{d}h^2} &= \frac{\beta^2}{2}\sum_{M=M_\text{min}}^{M_\text{max}}r^K_M\left[\frac{e^{\beta \frac{J}{4}}}{\theta_M}\left(2M\sinh \theta_M + \right.\right.\nonumber\\
								 &\left.\left.\frac{\beta^2 J^2}{4}\left[\frac{\cosh\theta_M}{\theta_M} - \frac{\sinh \theta_M}{\theta_M^2}\right]\Sigma_M\right)+ e^{-\beta JM/2}\right]
\end{align}
At low temperature \(\beta \to \infty\), only the highest value \(M_\text{max}\) will survive:
\begin{align}
	Z &\to 2 r^K_{M_\text{max}} M_\text{max} e^{\beta \frac{J}{2}(M_\text{max} + 1)}\\
	Z^{\prime \prime} &\to r^K_{M_\text{max}}\left(\frac{\beta }{2(M_\text{max} + \frac{1}{2})}\right)^2 e^{\beta \frac{J}{2}(M_\text{max} + 1)}\Sigma_{M_\text{max}}\\
	\chi &\to \frac{\beta\Sigma_\text{max}}{2M_\text{max}\left(2M_\text{max}+1\right)^2} = \frac{\beta(K-1)}{12(K+1)} \sim \frac{1}{T}
\end{align}

\end{figure}

\textit{This non-analyticity in a response function is a signature of the critical nature of the Hamiltonian. This is in contrast to the behaviour in the non-critical exactly-screened fixed point where the ground state is unique.} There, the susceptibility becomes constant at low temperatures: \(\chi(T\to 0) = \frac{W}{4 T_K}\), \(T_K\) being the single-channel Kondo temperature and \(W\) the Wilson number \cite{wilson1975renormalization,nozieres1974fermi,bullaNRGreview,kondo_urg}. We have checked the case of general spin-\(S\) impurity numerically, and the general conclusion is that all exactly-screened models show a constant impurity susceptibility at \(T \to 0\), while the over-screened and under-screened cases show a diverging impurity susceptibility in the same limit. 

Another non-analyticity arises when we consider the impurity free energy and the magnetization. The thermal free energy is given by
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	F(h) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\ln Z(h) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\ln\sum_{E_n}e^{-\beta E_n}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
At \(T \to 0\), only the most negative energy \(E_\text{min}\) survives. Assuming a non-degenerate ground state for \(h \neq 0\), the zero temperature free energy becomes
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	F(h\neq 0, T\to 0) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\ln e^{-\beta E_\text{min}} = E_\text{min}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
In the star graph Hamiltonian with \(K-\)channels and in the presence of a field on the impurity (eq.~\ref{stargraph_field_hamiltonian}), the ground state energy will be one of the negative eigenvalues:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\lambda^{M,h}_{m, -} = - \frac{J}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{J^2(M+1/2)^2 + h^2 + 2hJ(m+1/2)}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The minimum eigenvalue is obtained by maximizing \(h(m+1/2)\). For \(h>0\), the ground state is renormalised for the most positive value of \(m\), which is \(M-1\). On the other hand, for \(h<0\), it occurs for \(m=-M\), because that is the most negative value it can take. Among all the values of \(M\), the global ground state is at the largest value of \(M\), \(K/2\). Therefore, the minimal energy eigenvalue is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	E_\text{min} = - \frac{J}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{J^2(K+1)^2/4 + h^2 + |h|J(K-1)}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The first derivative of the free energy with respect to the field gives
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	F^\prime(h\neq 0, T\to 0) =- \frac{2h + J(K-1)\text{sign}(h)}{4\sqrt{\frac{J^2}{4}(K+1)^2 + h^2 + |h|J(K-1)}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
There we used the result that the derivative of \(|x|\) is \(\text{sign}(x)\). If we now take \(h\) to zero from both directions, we get the magnetization of the impurity
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	m = F^\prime(h \to 0^\pm, T\to 0) = \mp \frac{1}{2}\frac{(K-1)}{(K+1)}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{../numerics/disc_mag_imp_gen.pdf}
	\caption{Behaviour of the impurity magnetization for three values of \(\left(K, 2S\right) = \left(2, 4\right), \left( 3,3 \right), \left(4, 2\right)  \). Only the case of \(K=2S=3 \left(\delta=0\right)\) is analytic near zero. The non-analyticity of the other cases arises because of the frustration brought about by the degeneracy of the star graph ground state.}
	\label{mag_crit}
\end{figure}

The magnetization is therefore discontinuous as \(h\to 0\); it goes to different values depending on the direction in which we take the limit. The non-analyticity for \(K>1\) occurs because there is at least one pair of ground state with non-zero parity \(\pi^z\) and magnetic field is able to flip one ground state into the state of opposite parity. This available space for scattering is simply the frustration that we discussed earlier. This argument, along with the diverging susceptibility for the over- and under-screened cases, makes it clear that \textit{the non-analyticity and hence the critical nature of the fixed point arise because of the ground state degeneracy, and is therefore a feature of all over-screened and under-screened  models}. Indeed, we have checked numerically (see fig.~\ref{mag_crit}) that the non-analyticity exists for \(\delta \neq 0\), where \(\delta = \frac{K}{2} - S\) is the deviation from exact screening. For \(\delta=0\), the ground state is unique and un-frustrated, so the external magnetic field has no parity-inverted pair to flip across.

\subsection{Impurity magnetization in terms of parity operators}
Just like the complete string operator \(\pi^z\), the modified string operator \(\sigma_d^z \pi^z\) is also a Wilson loop operator that wraps around only the outer nodes of the star graph:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\pi^z_c \equiv \sigma_d^z \pi^z = \exp\left[i \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\sum_{l=1}^K \sigma^z_l - K\right)\right] 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The expectation value of the impurity magnetization along a particular direction and in specific ground states can be related to the 't Hooft operator defined under eq.~\ref{w_loop}. We will work in the state comprised of two adjacent eigenstates of \(J^z\):
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\ket{g^\theta_{J^z}} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left( \ket{J^z} + e^{i\theta}\ket{J^z+1}\right), && J^z < \frac{1}{2}\left( K-1 \right)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The expectation value of the impurity magnetization operator \(\sigma_d^x\) can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\left<\sigma_d^x\right> \equiv \langle g^\theta_{J^z} \vert \sigma_d^x \vert g^\theta_{J^z}\rangle = - \langle J^z + 1 \vert \pi^x_c \vert -J^z \rangle + \text{h.c.}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
This expression relates the observable impurity magnetization to the topological 't Hooft operator \cite{Maric2020}. Evaluating the matrix elements gives
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{sigmax}
	\left<\sigma_d^x\right> = - \frac{\sqrt{K^2 - (2J^z + 1)^2}}{2(1+K)}\cos \theta
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Performing a similar calculation reveals that the impurity magnetizations along \(y\) and \(z\) in the same state are given by
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{sigmayz}
	\left<\sigma_d^y\right> = - \frac{\sqrt{K^2 - (2J^z + 1)^2}}{2(1+K)}\sin \theta, &&\left<\sigma_d^z\right> = - \frac{2J^z + 1}{(1+K)}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Combining eqs.~\ref{sigmax} and \ref{sigmayz}, we find
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\cos^2\theta\left(\left<\sigma^x_d\right>\right)^2 + \sin^2\theta\left(\left<\sigma^y_d\right>\right)^2 + \frac{1}{4}\left(\left<\sigma^z_d\right>\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{K}{1+K}\right)^2
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\textit{This relation constrains the values of the magnetization along all the directions: the \(x\) and \(y\) magnetization values have already been shown to be related to the `t Hooft operators \(\pi^x\) and \(\pi^y\) and the magnetization along \(z\) is therefore constrained in terms of the `t Hooft operators and the quantized function on the right-hand side (the function is quantized because \(K\) can only take integer values).}






\section{Effect of conduction bath excitations on the fixed point theory}
\subsection{Non-Fermi liquid signatures in momentum space}
Obtaining the effective Hamiltonian involves obtaining the low energy excitations on top of the ground state of the star graph. The large-energy excitations are ones that involve spin flips. This guides the separation of the Hamiltonian into a diagonal and an off-diagonal piece:
\begin{align}
	H = H_d + V = \underbrace{H_0 + J S_d^z s_\text{tot}^z}_{H_d} + \underbrace{\frac{J}{2}S_d^+ s_\text{tot}^- + \text{h.c.}}_{V + V^\dagger}
\end{align}
We define \(V\) as the interaction term that decreases \(s_\text{tot}^z\) by 1: \(V \ket{s_\text{tot}^z} \to \ket{s_\text{tot}^z - 1}\). Similarly, we define \(V^\dagger \ket{s_\text{tot}^z} \to \ket{s_\text{tot}^z + 1}\). The effective Hamiltonian that has the states \(\ket{S_d^z, s_\text{tot}, s_\text{tot}^z}\) as eigenstates are
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
	H_\text{eff} = H_d + V \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - H_d}V = H_d + \frac{J}{2}S_d^+ s_\text{tot}^- \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - J S_d^z s_\text{tot}^z - H_0}\frac{J}{2}S_d^- s_\text{tot}^+ +\frac{J}{2}S_d^- s_\text{tot}^+ \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - J S_d^z s_\text{tot}^z - H_0}\frac{J}{2}S_d^+ s_\text{tot}^-
\end{align}
This is obtained from the Schrodinger equation for the ground state. If we expand the ground state in terms of \(\ket{S_d^z, s_\text{tot}, s_\text{tot}^z}\), we have  \(\ket{\Psi_\text{gs}} = \sum_{S_d^z, s_\text{tot},s_\text{tot}^z}C_{S_d^z, s_\text{tot},s_\text{tot}^z}\ket{S_d^z, s_\text{tot}, s_\text{tot}^z}\). The Schrodinger equation for the ground state can be written as
\begin{align}
	E_\text{gs}\ket{\Psi_\text{gs}} = H \ket{\Psi_\text{gs}} = \left(H_d + V\right)\ket{\Psi_\text{gs}} \implies \left(E_\text{gs} - H_d\right)\sum C_{S_d^z, s_\text{tot},s_\text{tot}^z}\ket{S_d^z, s_\text{tot}, s_\text{tot}^z} = V\sum C_{S_d^z, s_\text{tot},s_\text{tot}^z}\ket{S_d^z, s_\text{tot}, s_\text{tot}^z}
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
\(E_\text{gs}\) is the ground state energy, and can be replaced by the star graph ground state energy if we remove the kinetic energy cost via normal ordering: \(E_\text{gs} = -\frac{J}{2}\left(\frac{K}{2}+1\right) \). Since the interaction part \(V\) only changes \(S_d^z \to -S_d^z\) and \(s^z_\text{tot} \to s^z_\text{tot} \pm 1\), we can simplify the equation into individual smaller equations. For the two-channel model, the possible states are \((s_\text{tot},s^z_\text{tot}) = (0,0), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)\). The individual equations for these states are
\begin{align}
	\label{eff_ham_Sdz_10}
	E_\text{gs} \ket{\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0} &= \left(H_d + V \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - H_d}V^\dagger\right) \ket{\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0}\\
	E_\text{gs} \ket{-\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0} &= \left(H_d + V^\dagger \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - H_d} V\right) \ket{-\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0}\\
\end{align}
These equations represent the Schrodinger equation for the states \(\ket{S_d^z, 1, 0}\), and the right hand sides therefore give the effective Hamiltonians for those states. If we combine the states into a single subspace \(\ket{1,0}= \left\{\ket{\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0}, \ket{-\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0}\right\}\), the effective Hamiltonian for this composite subspace becomes the sum of the two parts:
\begin{align}
	\label{eff_ham_10}
	H^{1,0}_\text{eff}\ket{1, 0}\bra{1, 0} = \left(H_d + V G_0 V^\dagger + V^\dagger G_0  V\right) \ket{1, 0}
\end{align}
where \(G_0 = \left(E_\text{gs} - H_d\right)^{-1}\). If we expand the subspace as \(\ket{1,0} = \ket{\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0} + \ket{-\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0}\), we recover eqs.~\ref{eff_ham_Sdz_10}. Solving similarly for the other states gives
\begin{align}
	H^{1,1}_\text{eff}\ket{1,  1}\bra{1,  1} &= \left(H_d + V^\dagger G_0  V\right) \ket{1,  1}\\
	H^{1,-1}_\text{eff}\ket{1, - 1}\bra{1, - 1} &= \left(H_d + V G_0 V^\dagger\right) \ket{1, - 1}
\end{align}

To calculate these effective Hamiltonians, we will calculate the individual terms. We can easily simplify the \(S_d^z\) in the denominator of \(G_0\), because \(S_d^\pm \frac{1}{A + B S_d^z} = S_d^\pm \frac{1}{A \mp \frac{1}{2}B}\):
\begin{align}
	V G_0 V^\dagger = \frac{J^2}{4} s_\text{tot}^- \frac{\frac{1}{2} + S_d^z}{E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z - H_0} s_\text{tot}^+ \\
	V^\dagger G_0 V = \frac{J^2}{4} s_\text{tot}^+ \frac{\frac{1}{2} - S_d^z}{E_\text{gs} - \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z - H_0} s_\text{tot}^-
\end{align}
Since \(H_0\) does not commute with the spin operators, we will need to expand the denominator to make sense of this Hamiltonian.
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
	 V G_0 V^\dagger =  s_\text{tot}^- \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}\left[1 + \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}H_0 + \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}H_0\frac{1}{E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}H_0 + \ldots\right] s_\text{tot}^+\\
	 V^\dagger G_0 V =  s_\text{tot}^+ \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}\left[1 + \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}H_0 + \frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}H_0\frac{1}{E_\text{gs} - \frac{J}{2} s_\text{tot}^z}H_0 + \ldots\right] s_\text{tot}^-
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
This is an expansion in \(H_0^n/J^{n+1}, n=0,1,2,\ldots\). Expanding up to \(n=2\) and keeping at most two particle interaction terms, 
the effective Hamiltonians for these states are:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
	H_\text{eff}^{1, 1} &= H_0 + J S_d^z + \frac{J^2}{4}\frac{2}{E_\text{gs}}\left[1 + \frac{H_0}{E_\text{gs}} + \frac{s^+_\text{tot}X_{1,\text{tot}}}{2 E_\text{gs}} + \frac{H_0^2 }{E_\text{gs}^2} - \frac{Z_{1,\text{tot}} H_0}{E_\text{gs}^3}\right] \left(\frac{1}{2} - S_d^z\right) \\
	H_\text{eff}^{1, -1} &= H_0 - J S_d^z + \frac{J^2}{4}\frac{2}{E_\text{gs}}\left[1 + \frac{H_0}{E_\text{gs}}  - \frac{s^-_\text{tot}X^\dagger_{1,\text{tot}}}{2 E_\text{gs}}  + \frac{H_0^2}{E_\text{gs}^2}  - \frac{ Z_{1,\text{tot}} H_0}{E_\text{gs}^3}\right] \left(\frac{1}{2} + S_d^z\right) \\
	H_\text{eff}^{1, 0} &= H_0 + \frac{J^2}{2\left(E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2}\right)}\left[1 + \frac{ H_0 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + S_d^z\right) s^+_\text{tot}X_{1,\text{tot}} - \left(\frac{1}{2} - S_d^z\right) s^-_\text{tot}X^\dagger_{1,\text{tot}}}{2 \left(E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2}\right)} + \frac{H_0^2}{\left(E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2}\right)^2} - \frac{Z_{1,\text{tot}} H_0}{\left(E_\text{gs} + \frac{J}{2}\right)^3} \right]
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
We employed the definitions \(X_{n,\text{tot}} \equiv  \sum_l \sum_{k,k^\prime}\left(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_{k^\prime}\right)^n c^\dagger_{k \downarrow}c_{k^\prime \uparrow},  X_{n,l}\) and \( Z_{1,\text{tot}} \equiv \sum_{k,k^\prime,l}\left( \epsilon_k - \epsilon_{k^\prime} \right) \frac{1}{2}\left(c^\dagger_{k \uparrow,l}c_{k^\prime \uparrow,l} - c^\dagger_{k \downarrow,l}c_{k^\prime \downarrow,l}\right)\). Focusing on the effective Hamiltonian for \(\left( 1,0 \right) \), we see lots of non-Fermi liquid terms of the form \(s^+_\text{tot}X_{1,\text{tot}}, s^-_\text{tot}X^\dagger_{1,\text{tot}},Z_{1,\text{tot}} H_0\). These arise because of the degenerate manifold and the increased availability of states in the Hilbert space for scattering, as compared to the unique singlet ground state of the single-channel Kondo model.

\subsection{Local low-energy effective Hamiltonian}
Here we start with the low energy zero mode fixed point Hamiltonian for the two-channel Kondo obtained under URG treatment. Our goal here is to add excitations on top of this ground state and using the perturbation theory. In doing so we consider the leading order scatter appearing in the lowest order in the perturbative expansion. Note, in the fixed point zero mode Hamiltonian impurity spin is coupled with the bath electrons via spin exchange coupling, there is no charge exchange coupling present. 
\begin{eqnarray}
H^{(2)}&=& \alpha \vec{S}_{imp}.(\vec{S}_1+\vec{S}_2)~~,~~\vec{S}_i =  \frac{1}{2}~ c_{i,\alpha}^{\dagger}~ \vec{\sigma}_{\alpha,\beta}~ c_{i,\beta}
\label{eq:channel-2-spin}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\vec{S}_i=1,2$ represents the spin degree of freedom present in the origin of the $i^{th}$ channel. Thus one can rewrite the Eq.\eqref{eq:channel-2-spin} interms of the electronic degree of freedom as,
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\mathcal{H}_0 &= H_{0_1}+H_{0_2}\\
		      &= \alpha S^z_{imp}.\bigg(\frac{n_{1,\uparrow}-n_{1,\downarrow}}{2} \bigg) + \frac{1}{2} \bigg( S_{imp}^{+} c^{\dagger}_{1,\downarrow} c_{1,\uparrow} - S_{imp}^{-} c_{1,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{1,\downarrow} \bigg)\\
		      &+\alpha S^z_{imp}.\bigg(\frac{n_{2,\uparrow}-n_{2,\downarrow}}{2} \bigg) + \frac{1}{2} \bigg( S_{imp}^{+} c^{\dagger}_{2,\downarrow} c_{2,\uparrow} - S_{imp}^{-} c_{2,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{2,\downarrow} \bigg)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Here the basis we are interested in is $\{\mathcal{B}\}=\{|S^z_{imp},n_{1,\uparrow},n_{1,\downarrow},n_{2,\uparrow},n_{2,\downarrow}\rangle \}$. In this basis we write down all $2^3=8$ states of the spin Hamiltonian eq.\eqref{eq:channel-2-spin}
\begin{eqnarray}
|\alpha_0\rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \bigg[2|\Downarrow,1,0,1,0\rangle-|\Uparrow,0,1,1,0\rangle-|\Uparrow,1,0,0,1\rangle\bigg] \nonumber\\
|\alpha_1\rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \bigg[2|\Uparrow,0,1,0,1\rangle-|\Downarrow,1,0,0,1\rangle-|\Downarrow,0,1,1,0\rangle\bigg] \nonumber\\
&& E_{\alpha_0}= E_{\alpha_1}= -\alpha
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
|\beta_0\rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bigg[|\Downarrow,1,0,0,1\rangle-|\Downarrow,0,1,1,0\rangle \bigg] \nonumber\\
|\beta_1\rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg[ |\Uparrow,1,0,0,1\rangle-|\Uparrow,0,1,1,0\rangle \bigg]\nonumber\\
&& E_{\beta_1}=E_{\beta_2}=0
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
|\gamma_{0}\rangle &=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \bigg[|\Uparrow,0,1,0,1\rangle+|\Downarrow,1,0,0,1\rangle+|\Downarrow,0,1,1,0\rangle \bigg] \nonumber\\
|\gamma_{1}\rangle &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\bigg[ |\Uparrow,1,0,0,1\rangle+|\Uparrow,0,1,1,0\rangle+|\Downarrow,1,0,1,0\rangle \bigg] \nonumber\\
|\gamma_{2}\rangle &=& |\Uparrow,1,0,1,0\rangle \nonumber\\
|\gamma_{3}\rangle &=& |\Downarrow,0,1,0,1\rangle \\
&& E_{\gamma_0}=E_{\gamma_1}=E_{\gamma_2}=E_{\gamma_3}=\frac{\alpha}{2}
\end{eqnarray}
Note this spin Hamiltonian has total $8$ states, where ground state is double degenerate with energy $-\alpha$ and the lowest exicites state with energy $0$ is also double degnerate and the second excited state with energy $\alpha/2$ is 4-fold degenerate. 
\par On top of the zero mode spin-channel interactions we want to consider the effect of the momentum space kinetic energy term $\sum_{k}\epsilon_k (n_{1,k}+n_{2,k})$. We assume identical dispersion for both the channels. Our zero mode spin Hamiltonian is written in the real space, thus it will be easier to do the perterbation theory on the real space. The fourier transformation of the momentum space kinetic energy  term leads to real space hopping term. For simplicity we will be considering the neareast neighbor hoppings between sites within each channels. The real space hopping contributino to the Hamiltonian $H_X$ with the hooping strength is 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{X} &=& -t \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{<1,l_1> \\ <2,l_2>}} (c^{\dagger}_{1,\sigma}c_{l_1,\sigma}+c^{\dagger}_{2,\sigma}c_{l_2,\sigma}+ ~\textrm{h.c.})
\end{eqnarray}
Here $l_i$ represents the nearest site to the origin of the $i^{th}$ channel. Thus here we are interested in studying the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_0+H_X$. The perterbating term $H_x$ contains scattering which takes the states of the zero mode Hamltonain out of spin-channel scattering space. Thus befor we start the perturbation theroy we must expand the basis of the zero mode Hamiltonian itself. Thus the basis which contains the nearest neighbor sites of both the channels is given as 
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\{\mathcal{B}_{extnd}\} \equiv  \{\mathcal{B}\} \otimes  \{|n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle\} \nonumber\\
&=& \{|S^z_{imp},n_{1,\uparrow},n_{1,\downarrow},n_{2,\uparrow},n_{2,\downarrow}\rangle \otimes |n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle\} \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
Note there are $2^4=16$ elements in the subspace $\{|n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle\}$. In the spin-channel basis $\{\mathcal{B}\}$ there $2$ degenerate ground states. Because the unpurterbed Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_0$ has no scattering terms outside the spin sector, in the extended basis $\{\mathcal{B}_{extnd}\}$ the total ground state deneracy becomes simply $2\times 2^4$, $32$ fold. Thus the total hamiltonian we are interested in is 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H} &= \frac{\alpha\hbar}{2}~ \vec{S}_d. \displaystyle\sum_{i=\{1,2\}} \displaystyle\sum_{\alpha,\beta\in\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}}c_{i\alpha}^{\dagger} \vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} c_{i\alpha}\nonumber\\
	    &-t\displaystyle\sum_{i=\{1,2\}}\displaystyle\sum_{\substack{\langle i,l_i \rangle\\ \sigma}}(c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c_{l_i,\sigma}+ \textrm{h.c.}) 
%\\
%&=& \displaystyle\sum_{i=1,2} \bigg[ \alpha\hbar~ \vec{S}_d. \vec{S}_i -t\displaystyle\sum_{\substack{\langle i,l_i \rangle\\ \sigma}}(c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c_{l_i,\sigma}+ \textrm{h.c.}) \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=& \mathcal{H}_0+H_X
\end{align}
There are two degenrate states $|\alpha_1\rangle$ and $|\alpha_2\rangle$. Thus the two degenerate ground states in the above basis is give as,
\begin{eqnarray}
|\tilde{\alpha}_0\rangle &=&| {\alpha}_0\rangle\otimes |n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle \\
|\tilde{\alpha}_1\rangle &=& | {\alpha}_1\rangle\otimes |n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle
\end{eqnarray}
Using degenerate perturbation theory we calculate the first and the second order corrections to the Hamiltonian. The first order and the second order low energy effective Hamiltonian is given as 
\begin{eqnarray}
H^{(1)} &=& \sum_{ij} |\alpha_i\rangle \langle \alpha_i  | V| \alpha_j \rangle \langle \alpha_j |~\nonumber\\
H^{(2)} &=& \sum_{ij} \sum_l |\alpha_i\rangle \frac{\langle \alpha_i  | V| \mu_l \rangle \langle \mu_l  | V| \alpha_j \rangle}{E_0-E_{l}}\langle \alpha_j |
\end{eqnarray}
where $|\alpha_i\rangle$ represents the ground states with energy $E_0$ and $\mu_l$ represents the ecvited states with energy $E_l$. One can easily check the diagonal term in effective Hamiltonain coming from the $1^{st}$ or any $odd$ order correction is zero as the state never returns to the original starting state via odd number of scatterings. For the case of first order it is easy to see that the off-diagonal correction to the effective Hamiltonian is also zero. Thus the lowest order where we expect the non-zero corrections is the second order. We first calculate the diagonal correction in the first order
\begin{eqnarray}
H^{(2)}_{diag} &=& \sum_{i} \sum_l |\alpha_i\rangle\langle \alpha_i | \frac{|\langle \alpha_i  | V| \mu_l \rangle|^2 }{E_0-E_{l}}
\end{eqnarray}
As single scattering always takes the state outside of the spin-channel, the state $V|\alpha_i\rangle$ is an excited state with energy $0$ ($=E_l$). This $\alpha_i$ representing the ground state can take total $32$ configurations as discussed. Out of this $32$ states $| {\alpha}_0\rangle\otimes |n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle$ can take $16$ configurations and $| {\alpha}_1\rangle\otimes |n_{l_1,\uparrow},n_{l_1,\downarrow},n_{l_2,\uparrow},n_{l_2,\downarrow}\rangle$ can take the rest 16 configurations. Note the two degnereate states $|\tilde{\alpha}_0\rangle$  and $|\tilde{\alpha}_1\rangle$ is labeled by the $J^z$ eigenvalue $\pm 1/2$ respectively, where $J^z$ is the total z-component of the impurity and zero modes of the baths. Thus these $32$ ground states can be seperated in two 16 state groups labeled by the $J^z=\pm 1/2$ eigenvalues. For the $J^z=1/2$ sector we get the effective Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H^{(2)}_{diag} (1/2) = \frac{2t^2}{E_0} \hat{I} - \frac{2t^2}{3E_0} \bigg[ (n_{l_1\uparrow}-n_{l_1\downarrow}) +(n_{l_2\uparrow}-n_{l_2\downarrow}) \bigg]
%= \frac{2t^2}{E_0} \hat{I} - \frac{4t^2}{3E_0} \bigg[S_{l_1}^z+S_{l_2}^z\bigg]
\end{equation}
Similarly the for $J^z=-1/2$ we get 
\begin{equation}
H^{(2)}_{diag} (1/2) = \frac{2t^2}{E_0} \hat{I} + \frac{2t^2}{3E_0} \bigg[ (n_{l_1\uparrow}-n_{l_1\downarrow}) +(n_{l_2\uparrow}-n_{l_2\downarrow}) \bigg]
%= \frac{2t^2}{E_0} \hat{I} + \frac{4t^2}{3E_0} \bigg[S_{l_1}^z+S_{l_2}^z\bigg]
\end{equation}
Thus the diagonal part of the effective Hamiltonian in the second order is 
\begin{eqnarray}
H^{(2)}_{diag} &=& \sum_{i} \sum_l |\alpha_i\rangle\langle \alpha_i | \frac{|\langle \alpha_i  | V| \mu_l \rangle|^2 }{E_0-E_{l}} \nonumber\\
%= H^{(2)}_{diag} (1/2)+H^{(2)}_{diag} (-1/2)= \frac{4t^2}{E_0} \hat{I}\nonumber\\
&=& -4t^2 \hat{I}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\hat{I}$ is the identity operator made out of all $2^4=16$ possible number operator combinations as shown below
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{I} &=& \sum_{\hat{o}=\hat{n},(1-\hat{n})} \hat{o}_{l_1,\uparrow}\hat{o}_{l_1,\downarrow} \hat{o}_{l_2,\uparrow}\hat{o}_{l_2,\downarrow}
\end{eqnarray}
Now we are interested in calcualting the offdiagonal term present in the second order low energy effective Hamiltonian which is given as
\begin{eqnarray}
H^{(2)}_{off} &=& \sum_{i\neq j} \sum_l |\alpha_i\rangle \frac{\langle \alpha_i  | V| \mu_l \rangle \langle \mu_l  | V| \alpha_j \rangle}{E_0-E_{l}}\langle \alpha_j | \nonumber\\
&=& -\frac{8t^2}{3} \bigg[ (S_1^z)^2 c_{2\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{2\downarrow} \bigg(  c_{l_1\uparrow}c_{l_1\downarrow}^{\dagger} +  c_{l_2\uparrow}c_{l_2\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg) \nonumber\\
&+& (S_2^z)^2 c_{1\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{1\downarrow} \bigg(  c_{l_1\uparrow}c_{l_1\downarrow}^{\dagger} +  c_{l_2\uparrow}c_{l_2\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg)\bigg] + \textrm{h.c.} \nonumber\\
\label{eq:hamiltonian_NFL}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{Studying the LEH}
\subsubsection{Self energy and Specific heat}
Here we study this LEH to understant valrious features like change in the self-energy, and the nature of the momentum space Hamiltonian. To calculate the self energy we fo Hartee-Fock to get the shift in the kinetic energy.
In the real space one can get a diagonal piece from the above equation by using the Fermionic anticommutation relations.
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff}^{off,(2)} |_{diag} &=& -\frac{16t^2}{3} [ (S_1^z)^2+ (S_2^z)^2 ]  \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
We can find the corresponding momentum space Hamiltonian by doing the fouries transforamtion to the Hamiltonian $H_{eff}^{off,(2)} |_{diag} $.
\begin{eqnarray}
%&&-\frac{16t^2}{3}\bigg[\bigg(\frac{1}{4N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{2N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1\uparrow} n_{k_2\downarrow} \bigg) + \bigg(\frac{1}{4N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{2N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} \tilde{n}_{k_1\uparrow} \tilde{n}_{k_2\downarrow} \bigg) \bigg] \nonumber\\
H_{eff}^{off,(2)} |_{diag}&=& -\frac{4t^2}{3} \frac{1}{N} \bigg[ \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}\bigg(1-\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k_2}  n_{k_2,-\sigma} \bigg) \nonumber\\
&&+ \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k\sigma}\bigg( 1-\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{ k_2} \tilde{n}_{k_2,-\sigma} \bigg) \bigg] \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
in momentum space we can do again the Hartee-Fock to measure the self-energy
\begin{eqnarray}
%\bar{\epsilon}_k&=& \epsilon_k+\Sigma_k \nonumber\\
\bar{\epsilon}
_k-\epsilon_k=\Sigma_k &=& -\frac{4t^2}{3N} \bigg(1-\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k_2}  \langle n_{k_2,-\sigma} \rangle \bigg) \nonumber\\
&&= -\frac{4t^2}{3N^2}\bigg(1-\frac{N}{e^{(\epsilon_k-\mu)/k_BT}+1}\bigg)
\label{eq:self-energy-NFL}
\end{eqnarray}
Using the self-energy we calculate the impurity speciftic heat defined as $C_{imp}=C(J^*)-C(0)$.
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{imp} &=& \sum_{\Lambda,\sigma} \beta \bigg[ \frac{(\bar{\epsilon}_{\Lambda})^2 e^{\beta \bar{\epsilon}_{\Lambda}}}{( e^{\beta \bar{\epsilon}_{\Lambda}} +1)^2}  -\frac{({\epsilon}_{\Lambda})^2 e^{\beta {\epsilon}_{\Lambda}}}{( e^{\beta {\epsilon}_{\Lambda}} +1)^2} \bigg]
\end{eqnarray}
Here we are intersted in the low temperature behavior of this impurity specific-heat. Using the self-energy obtained above we calculate the impurity susecptibility for $t=0.1$ and $\alpha=1$.

The above Fig.\ref{fig:Cv_imp} shows that at low temperature follows logarithmic behavior for the single channel case which is in agreement with the results known in the literature [CITE].
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{C_{imp}}{T} \propto \log T
\end{eqnarray}


\subsubsection{Exact diagonalization}
Here we do the exact diagonalization the NFL Hamiltonian eq.\eqref{eq:hamiltonian_NFL} and find the eigenspectrum. Using this eigen spectrum  we computer various quantitites like $\chi$. We can compute other quantities from this exact diagonalization. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi &=& \beta\bigg[\frac{\sum e^{-\beta \bar{\epsilon}_{\Lambda}} \langle \bar{S}^{z2} \rangle}{\sum e^{-\beta \bar{\epsilon}_{\Lambda}} } -\frac{\sum e^{-\beta \epsilon_{\Lambda}} \langle S^{z2 }\rangle }{\sum e^{-\beta \epsilon_{\Lambda}} } \bigg] 
\end{eqnarray}
We numerically compute the $\chi$ from the definition above and study it's dependence on temperature.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/NFL_Chi_log_0p1}
\end{figure}
The above figure shows that at low temperture
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi(T) &\propto& \log T
\end{eqnarray}
This matches with the already known result of the literature. The ratio $\frac{\chi(T)}{C_{imp}/T} \sim 8.3$ greater than the Wilson ration. One can check this quantity for larger system size and at lower temperature for an better agreement.


\subsubsection{Momentum space structure of the NFL}
Direct fourier transformation on the $H^{(2)}_{off}$ leads to the LEH in momentum space showing higher order scattering involving electronic degree of freedoms.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%H_{eff}^{off,(2)} \bigg|_{diag} &=&  \frac{4t^2}{3\alpha} \bigg[ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} n_{k_1,\sigma} n_{k_2,-\sigma} \bigg] \times \bigg[\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1,\sigma} -  \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1\sigma}\tilde{n}_{k_2,-\sigma}\bigg] \nonumber\\
%\end{eqnarray}
The Fourier transformation of the electronic creation operator gives
%\begin{eqnarray}
%c_{r\sigma}^{\dagger} &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \displaystyle\sum_{k} e^{-ikr} c_{k\sigma}^{\dagger}~,~\rightarrow c_{r\sigma} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \displaystyle\sum_{k} e^{ikr} c_{k\sigma} \nonumber\\
%c_{r,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{r,-\sigma} &=& \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,k'} e^{-i(k-k')r} c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k',-\sigma}    \nonumber\\
%n_{r\sigma}&=& c_{r\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{r\sigma} = \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,k'} e^{-i(k-k')r} c_{k\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k'\sigma} \nonumber\\
%n_{r\uparrow}n_{r\downarrow} &=& \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{k_1,k_2\\k_3,k_4}} e^{-i(k_1-k_2)r} e^{-i(k_3-k_4)r} c_{k_1\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k_2\uparrow} c_{k_3\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{k_4\downarrow}  
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%n_{r\uparrow}+n_{r\downarrow}-2n_{r\uparrow}n_{r\downarrow} &=& \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,k',\sigma} e^{-i(k-k')r} c_{k\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k'\sigma} -\frac{2}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{k_1,k_2\\k_3,k_4}} e^{-i(k_1-k_2)r} e^{-i(k_3-k_4)r} c_{k_1\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k_2\uparrow} c_{k_3\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{k_4\downarrow}   \nonumber\\
%\textrm{The diagonal piece from this}  &\Downarrow & \nonumber\\
%&& \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{2}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1\uparrow} n_{k_2\downarrow}
%\end{eqnarray}


Thus one gets,
\begin{eqnarray}
(S_1^z)^2 \bigg|_{diag} &=& \frac{1}{4} (n_{1\uparrow}-n_{1\downarrow})^2\bigg|_{diag}=(n_{1\uparrow}+n_{1\downarrow}-2n_{1\uparrow}n_{1\downarrow})/4 \bigg|_{diag}\nonumber\\
%&=& \frac{1}{4N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{2N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1\uparrow} n_{k_2\downarrow} \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{1}{4N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{4N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} n_{k_1,\sigma} n_{k_2,-\sigma}
\end{eqnarray}
We know that the diagoanl peice of the following terms is given as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%c_{r,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{r,\downarrow}  c_{r',\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{r',\downarrow} &=& \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{k_1,k_2\\k_3,k_4}} e^{-i(k_1-k_2)r} e^{-i(k_3-k_4)r} c_{k_1,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k_2,\downarrow} c_{k_4,\uparrow}c_{k_3,\downarrow}^{\dagger}  \bigg|_{diag} \nonumber\\
%%&\Downarrow & \nonumber\\
%%&& \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{k_1,k_2}} e^{-i(k_1-k_2)r} e^{-i(k_2-k_1)r} c_{k_1,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k_2,\downarrow} c_{k_1,\uparrow}c_{k_2,\downarrow}^{\dagger}  \bigg|_{diag} \nonumber\\
%&=& -\frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1\uparrow}(1-n_{k_2\downarrow})
%\end{eqnarray}

Thus the diagonal piece coming from the term,
\begin{eqnarray}
&& c_{2\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{2\downarrow} \bigg(  c_{l_1\uparrow}c_{l_1\downarrow}^{\dagger} +  c_{l_2\uparrow}c_{l_2\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg)\Rightarrow \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,k'} e^{-i(k-k')r} c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k',-\sigma}  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{widetext}
Thus we get the diagonal correction of effective Hamiltonian in the momoentum spcae,
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff}^{off,(2)} \bigg|_{diag} &=& -\frac{8t^2}{3} \bigg[ \frac{1}{4N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{2N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1\uparrow} n_{k_2\downarrow} \bigg] \times \bigg[\frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} \tilde{n}_{k_1\uparrow}(1-\tilde{n}_{k_2\downarrow}) + (\uparrow \rightarrow \downarrow)\bigg] \times 2 \nonumber\\
%&=& -\frac{2t^2}{3} \bigg[ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{2}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1\uparrow} n_{k_2\downarrow} \bigg] \times \bigg[\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1,\sigma} -  \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1\sigma}\tilde{n}_{k_2,-\sigma}\bigg]\times 2 \nonumber\\
&=& -\frac{4t^2}{3} \bigg[ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} n_{k_1,\sigma} n_{k_2,-\sigma} \bigg] \times \bigg[\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1,\sigma} -  \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1\sigma}\tilde{n}_{k_2,-\sigma}\bigg]~,~~~~ 
\end{eqnarray}
%
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%H_{eff}^{off,(2)} \bigg|_{diag} &=&  -\frac{4t^2}{3} \bigg[ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k,\sigma} n_{k\sigma}-\frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2} n_{k_1,\sigma} n_{k_2,-\sigma} \bigg] \times \bigg[\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1,\sigma} -  \frac{1}{N^2} \displaystyle\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma} \tilde{n}_{k_1\sigma}\tilde{n}_{k_2,-\sigma}\bigg] \nonumber\\
%\label{eq:off-ham-110}
%\end{eqnarray}


\end{widetext}

\noindent Where $n_{k,\sigma}$ and $\tilde{n}_{k,\sigma}$ are the occupation of the states $k,\sigma$ corresponding to two different channels. One can define the charge density of $i^{th}$ channel with the spin-$\sigma$ as 
\begin{eqnarray}
q_{i,\sigma}=\frac{Q_{i,\sigma}}{N}=\frac{1}{N}  \displaystyle\sum_{k} n_{k,\sigma}
\end{eqnarray}
Thus one can re-write the abeove equation as,
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff}^{off,(2)} \bigg|_{diag} &=& -\frac{4t^2}{3} \prod_{i=\{1,2\}} \bigg[q_{i,\uparrow}+q_{i,\downarrow}-q_{i,\uparrow}q_{i,\downarrow}\bigg] \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
This shows the inter-channel charge coupling present in the excitation spectrum.


\subsection{Third order}


\noindent Thus the off-diagonal part of the effective low energy Hamiltonian in the 2nd order is
\begin{eqnarray}
&&H_{eff, off}^{(2)} 
= \frac{J^2}{\alpha}\bigg[ c_{1\uparrow}c_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg(-\alpha\beta \bigg\{\Sigma_{3,2} + c_{3\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{3\downarrow} c_{2\uparrow} c_{2\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg\}-\alpha\gamma \Omega_{3,2}\bigg) \nonumber\\
&&~~~~+c_{2\uparrow}c_{2\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg(-\alpha\beta \bigg\{\Sigma_{1,3} + c_{1\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{1\downarrow} c_{3\uparrow} c_{3\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg\}-\alpha\gamma \Omega_{1,3}\bigg) \nonumber\\
&&~~+c_{3\uparrow}c_{3\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg(-\alpha\beta \bigg\{\Sigma_{2,1} + c_{2\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{2\downarrow} c_{1\uparrow} c_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger} \bigg\}-\alpha\gamma \Omega_{2,1}\bigg) + \textrm{h.c.} \bigg]
\nonumber\\
&&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\otimes \bigg[ c_{l_1\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{l_1\downarrow} +c_{l_2\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{l_2\downarrow} + c_{l_3\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{l_3\downarrow} + \textrm{h.c.}\bigg] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
 \begin{eqnarray}
\Sigma_{i,j} &=&-8S_i^zS_j^z  [  (C^z_i-C^z_j  )^2  + (S_i^z-S_j^z  )^2  ] \\
\Omega_{i,j} &=& 4S_i^z S_j^z (C_i^z+C_i^z)(C_j^z+C_j^z)
\end{eqnarray}

 
\noindent Now we are interested calculating the diagonal part of the effective Hamiltonian. In this case we get non-zero contribution from all the three ground states $|J^z=-1\rangle$, $|J^z=0\rangle$ and $|J^z=1\rangle$.
We get the diagonal contribution to the LEH in the second order is 
\begin{eqnarray}
H^{(2)}_{eff, diag} &=& - \frac{7.2 J^2}{\alpha} \hat{I}
\end{eqnarray}
The contribution associater to different ground states $|J^z=-1\rangle$, $|J^z=0\rangle$ and $|J^z=1\rangle$ is given respectively as $- \frac{2.4 J^2}{\alpha} \hat{I} + \hat{\mathcal{F}},- \frac{2.4 J^2}{\alpha} \hat{I} ,- \frac{2.4 J^2}{\alpha} \hat{I} - \hat{\mathcal{F} }$,
\noindent where $\hat{\mathcal{F}}$ is a function of diagonal number oprators of the nearest-neighbor site degree of freedom $l_1,l_2,l_3$ etc.

\subsection{Presence of a marginal Fermi liquid: Orthogonality catastrophe in two-channel MCK model}
At the stable fixed point \(J ^* = J_1^* = \frac{2}{K \rho}\), the ground states of the Hamiltonian are those of the star graph model, with a degeneracy of \(K\). We now specialise to the two-channel Kondo model. To find the low-energy excitations on top of this ground state manifold, we insert a tight-binding nearest-neighbour hopping between the zeroth site (the one that holds the impurity) and the first site (site that's nearest to the zeroth site) as a perturbation and calculate the diagonal and off-diagonal terms generated by this perturbation. It is found that when we trace out the impurity, we are left only with real space off-diagonal terms:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{nfl_terms}
	V_\text{eff} = \frac{2t^2}{J^*}\left[\left(\sigma^z_{0,1}\right)^2 s^+_{0,2} + \left(\sigma^z_{0,2}\right)^2 s^+_{0,1}\right] \left(s^-_{1,1} + s^-_{1,2}\right) + \text{h.c.}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where \(\sigma^z_{0,l} = \hat n_{0\uparrow,l} - \hat n_{0\downarrow,l}, s^+ = c^\dagger_{0 \uparrow,l}c_{0 \downarrow,l}\) and \(s^- = \left(s^+\right)^\dagger\). The notation \(0\sigma,l\) has the site index \(i=0,1,2,\ldots\) as the first label, the spin index \(\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow\) as the second label and the channel index \(l=1,2\) as the third index.

These are the terms that are generated because of the presence of the impurity. Such a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) contribution to the effective Hamiltonian and the absence of any Fermi-liquid term at the same order should be contrasted with the local Fermi liquid excitations induced by the singlet ground state of the single-channel Kondo model~\cite{nozieres1974fermi,wilson1975renormalization,hewson1993}. We wish to point out that such NFL terms were also obtained by Coleman, et al.~\cite{Coleman_tsvelik} in terms of Majorana fermions at the zeroth site and the first site of the \(\sigma-\tau\) version of the two-channel Kondo model. They then went on to compute a single-particle self-energy renormalisation coming from this NFL term that matches the phenomenological~\cite{varma2002singular} and microscopic forms of the marginal Fermi liquid self-energy~\cite{anirbanmott1,anirbanurg1}. We take a different route in order to calculate the self-energy contribution coming from Eq.~\ref{nfl_terms}.

In the URG analysis of the 2D Hubbard model at half-filling~\cite{anirbanurg1}, it was found that the normal phase of the Mott insulator was a metal with properties that have been phenomenologically attributed to the marginal Fermi liquid. The excitations of such a phase are described by a two particle-one hole composite object:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{mfl_urg}
	H_\text{MFL} = \sum_{k,k^\prime,k^{\prime\prime},\sigma}R \hat n_{k\sigma} \hat n_{k^\prime \overline\sigma}\left(1 - \hat n_{k^{\prime\prime}\sigma}\right) 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
We wish to look for such a term in the effective Hamiltonian. For this, we will perform a perturbative treatment of the hopping at strong coupling \(J \to \infty\) where the perturbative coupling \(t^2/J\) is arbitrarily small and again obtain Eq.~\ref{nfl_terms}. Such a change from the strong coupling model with parameter \(J\) to a weak coupling model with parameter \(t^2/J\) amounts to a duality transformation~\cite{kroha_kolf_2007,zitko_fabrizio_2017}. It can be shown that the duality transformation leads to an identical MCK model~\cite{kroha_kolf_2007} (self-duality), which implies we can have identical RG flows, and our transformation simply extracts the NFL piece from the dual model. The self-duality also ensures that the critical intermediate-coupling fixed point is unique and can be reached from either of the models.

The diagonal part of eq.~\ref{nfl_terms} is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	V_\text{eff} = \frac{2t^2}{J}\sum_{l=1,2}\left(\sum_\sigma \hat n_{0\sigma,l}\right) s^+_{0,\bar l}s^-_{1,\bar l} + \text{h.c.}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where \(\bar l = 3 - l\) is the channel index complementary to \(l\). We will fourier transform this effective Hamiltonian into \(k-\)space. The NFL part becomes
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{k_space_od}
	\sum_{\sigma, \left\{k_i,k_i^\prime\right\},l} \frac{2t^2}{J}e^{i\left(k_1 - k_1^\prime\right)a}c^\dagger_{k\sigma,l}c_{k^\prime\sigma,l}c^\dagger_{k_2 \uparrow, \bar l}c_{k_2^\prime \downarrow,\bar l}c^\dagger_{k_1 \downarrow,\bar l}c_{k_1^\prime \uparrow, \bar l} + \text{h.c.} 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
This form of the Hamiltonian is very similar to the three-particle interaction term in Appendix B of~\cite{anirbanmott1}. The channel indices in Eq.~\ref{k_space_od} can be mapped to the normal directions in~\cite{anirbanmott1}. As specualted eariler, the 2 particle-1 hole interaction in Eq.~\ref{k_space_od} has a diagonal component which can be obtained by setting \(k=k^\prime, k_1 = k_2^\prime\) and \(k_2 = k_1^\prime\):
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	H_\text{eff,MFL} = \sum_{k, k_1, \atop{k_2,\sigma,  l}} \frac{2t^2e^{i\left(k_1 - k_2\right)a}}{J} \hat n_{k\sigma,l} \hat n_{k_2 \uparrow, \bar l}\left(1 - \hat n_{k_1 \downarrow,\bar l}\right) + \text{h.c.}\\
	= \sum_{k, k_1, \atop{k_2,\sigma,  l}} \frac{4t^2}{J} \cos a\left(k_1 - k_2\right)  \hat n_{k\sigma,l} \hat n_{k_2 \uparrow, \bar l}\left(1 - \hat n_{k_1 \downarrow,\bar l}\right)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The most dominant contribution comes from \(k_1 = k_2 = k^\prime\), revealing the non-Fermi liquid metal~\cite{cox_jarrell_two_channel_rev,andrei_jerez_1995}:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{mfl_large}
	H^*_\text{eff,MFL} = \frac{4t^2}{J} \sum_{\sigma, k, k^\prime, l} \hat n_{k\sigma,l} \hat n_{k^\prime \uparrow, \bar l}\left(1 - \hat n_{k^\prime \downarrow,\bar l}\right)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Following~\cite{anirbanmott1}, one can follow the RG evolution of the dual coupling \(R_j = \frac{4t^2}{J_j}\) at the \(j^\text{rh}\) RG step, in the form of the URG equation
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta R_j =- \frac{R_j^2}{\omega - \epsilon_{j}/2 - R_j/8}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
In the RG equation, \(\epsilon_{j}\) represents the energy of the \(j^\text{th}\) isoenergetic shell. It is seen from the RG equation that \(R\) is relevant in the range of \(\omega < \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_j\) that has been used throughout, leading to a fixed-point at \(R^*/8 = \omega - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon^*)\). The relevance of \(R\) is expected because the strong coupling \(J\) is irrelevant and \(R \sim 1/J\).

The renormalisation in \(R\) leads to a renormalisation in the single-particle self-energy~\cite{anirbanmott1}. The \(k-\)space-averaged self-energy renormalisation is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta \Sigma(\omega) = \rho {R^*}^2\int_0^{\epsilon^*} \frac{d\epsilon_j}{\omega - \epsilon_j/2 + R_j/8}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The density of states can be approximated to be \(N^*/R^*\), where \(N^*\) is the total number of states over the interval \(R^*\). As suggested by the fixed point value of \(R_j\), we can approximate its behaviour near the fixed point by a linear dependence of the dispersion \(\epsilon_j\). The two limits of the integration are the start and end points of the RG. We start the RG very close to the Fermi surface and move towards the fixed point \(\epsilon^*\). Near the start point, we substitute \(\epsilon = 0\) and \(R = \omega\), following the fixed point condition. From the the fixed point condition, we also substitute \(R^*/8 = \omega - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon^*\). On defining \(\bar \omega = N^* \left(\omega - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon^*\right)\), we can write
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{self_energy}
	\Delta \Sigma(\omega) \sim  \bar \omega \ln \frac{N^* \omega}{\bar \omega}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The self-energy also provides the quasiparticle residue for each channel\cite{anirbanmott1}:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	Z(\bar\omega) = \left(2 - \ln \frac{2\bar\omega}{N^* \omega}\right) ^{-1}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\textit{As the energy scale \(\omega \to 0\), the \(Z\) vanishes, implying that the ground state and lowest-lying excitations, in the presence of the NFL terms, are not adiabatically connected to the Fermi gas. This is the orthogonality catastrophe~\cite{varma2002singular,anderson_infraredcat,yamada_catastrophe,yamada1979orthogonality} in the two-channel Kondo problem, and it is brought about by the presence of the terms in Eq.~\ref{mfl_large}}. Such terms were absent in the single-channel Kondo model, because there was no multiply-degenerate ground state manifold that allowed scattering. This line of argument shows that the extra degeneracy of the ground state subspace and the frustration of the singlet order that comes about when one upgrades from the single-channel Kondo model to the MCK models is at the heart of the NFL behaviour, and the orthogonality catastrophe should be a general feature of all such frustrated MCK models. A local NFL term with a self-energy of the form in eq.~\ref{self_energy} was also obtained in the \(\sigma-\tau\) model by Coleman et al.~\cite{Coleman_tsvelik}. The common features show the universality between the two-channel Kondo and the \(\sigma-\tau\) models.

\section{Local Mott liquid}

\noindent Using the unitary renormalization group method we decouple the impurity spin from the zero-modes of the $K$ channels. We start with the Hamiltonian. The zero mode Hamiltonian is a stargraph model 
\begin{eqnarray}
H &=& \alpha \vec{S}_d.\displaystyle\sum_i \vec{S}_i =\alpha S_d^zS^z + \frac{\alpha}{2} (S_d^+S^-+ S_d^-S^+) \nonumber\\
H_D &=& \alpha S^z_d S^z~,~~ H_X = \frac{\alpha}{2} (S_d^+S^-+ S_d^-S^+)
\end{eqnarray}
Here we want to remove the quantum fluctuations between the impurity spin and the rest, for that we do one step URG.

\begin{equation}
\Delta H = H_X \frac{1}{\hat{\omega}-H_D} H_X
%&=&\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^- S_d^+ \frac{1}{\omega_{\uparrow}-\alpha S_d^zS^z} S^-_d  S^+  \bigg] +\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^+ S_d^- \frac{1}{\omega_{\uparrow}-\alpha S_d^zS^z} S^+_d  S^-  \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=&\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^-S^+ S_d^+S^-_d \frac{1}{\omega_{\uparrow}-\alpha (S_d^z-1)(S^z+1)}     \bigg] +\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^+S^- S_d^-S^+_d \frac{1}{\omega_{\downarrow}-\alpha (S_d^z+1)(S^z-1)}     \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=&\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^-S^+(1/2+S^z_d) \frac{1}{\omega_{\uparrow}-\alpha (S_d^z-1)(S^z+1)}     \bigg] +\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^+S^-(1/2-S_d^z) \frac{1}{\omega_{\downarrow}-\alpha (S_d^z+1)(S^z-1)}     \bigg] \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
In the zero mode IR fixed point ground state (star graph) of multi-channel ground state $J^z$ is a good quantum number but $S^z$ is not. There is no net $S^z$ field thus in the ground state manifold the average $S^z$ is vanishing, $\langle S^z \rangle=0$. We use this expectation value to replace the denominator of the above RG equation.

%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Delta H &=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^-S^+ (1/2+S^z_d) \frac{1}{\omega_{\uparrow}-\alpha (S_d^z-1)(\langle S^z \rangle +1)}     \bigg] +\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^+S^- (1/2-S_d^z) \frac{1}{\omega_{\downarrow}-\alpha (S_d^z+1)(\langle S^z \rangle-1)}     \bigg] \nonumber\\
%%&=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^-S^+ (1/2+S^z_d) \frac{1}{\omega_{\uparrow}-\alpha (S_d^z-1 )}     \bigg] +\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^+S^- (1/2-S_d^z) \frac{1}{\omega_{\downarrow}+\alpha (S_d^z+1) }     \bigg] \nonumber\\
%%&=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^-S^+ (1/2+S^z_d) \Gamma_{\uparrow}\bigg] +\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ S^+S^- (1/2-S_d^z) \Gamma_{\downarrow} \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2}- S^z)(1/2+S^z_d) \Gamma_{\uparrow} \bigg]+\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2}+ S^z)(1/2-S^z_d) \Gamma_{\downarrow} \bigg] \nonumber\\
%\end{eqnarray}
%Due to unitary condition the $\omega_{\uparrow}$ and $\omega_{\downarrow}$ are constrained, which makes $\Gamma_{\uparrow}=\Gamma_{\downarrow}$. Thus we get
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Delta H &=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2}- S^z)(1/2+S^z_d)_{\uparrow} \Gamma_{\uparrow} \bigg]+\frac{\alpha^2}{4} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2}+ S^z)(1/2-S^z_d)_{\downarrow} \Gamma_{\downarrow} \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \Gamma_{\uparrow} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2}- S^z)(1/2+S^z_d)_{\uparrow} + (S^2-S^{z2}+ S^z)(1/2-S^z_d)_{\downarrow}  \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=& \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \Gamma_{\uparrow} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2}- S^z)(S^2_{d}-S^{z2}_d)  + (S^2-S^{z2}+ S^z)(S^2_{d}-S^{z2}_d)  \bigg]\nonumber\\
%&=& \frac{\alpha^2}{2} \Gamma_{\uparrow} \bigg[ (S^2-S^{z2})(S^2_{d}-S^{z2}_d)  \bigg]~,~~ \textrm{where $S_d^+S_{d}^-=(S_d^2-S_{d}^{z2}+S_d^z)=1/2+S_d^z$}
%\end{eqnarray}

Thus we get the effective Hamiltonian is 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff} &=& \frac{\alpha^2 \Gamma_{\uparrow}}{2} (S^2-S^{z2})(\tau^2_{d}-\tau^z_d)  \nonumber\\
&=& \beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})(S^2-S^{z2})(\tau^2_{d}-\tau^z_d)~,~~~\frac{\alpha^2 \Gamma_{\uparrow}}{2} =\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow}) \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{2} (S^2-S^{z2})   =\frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{4} (S^+S^-+S^-S^+)   
\end{eqnarray}
. In terms of the electronics degree of freedom this looks 
\begin{align}
&H_{eff}(\omega,\alpha) \nonumber\\
&= \frac{ \beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow}) }{4}    \displaystyle\sum_{i\neq j}\displaystyle\sum_{\substack{ \alpha_i,\beta_i\in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}\\ \alpha_j,\beta_j\in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}}}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha_i\beta_i}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha_j\beta_j}  c_{0\alpha_i}^{(i)\dagger}  c_{0\beta_i}^{(i)}    c_{0\alpha_j}^{(j)\dagger}  c_{0\beta_j}^{(j)}\nonumber\\
& ~~ +\textrm{h.c.}   
\label{eq:all-to-all_1}
\end{align}
We will study the two cases of the above effective Hamiltonian depending on the sign of the prefactor. The case $\frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{2} >0$ is the ferromagnetic case where in the ground state $S$ takes the minimum value and $S^z$ takes the possible maximum value. For an example, in the case of $K$ channels the minimum value of $S$ will be $0$ or $1/2$ for $K$ being $even $ or $odd$ respectively.  We will be interested in the other case where $\frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{2} <0$. In this case the ground state corresponds to $S$ being maximum and $S^z$ being minimum case. The effective Hamiltonian can be re-written in this case as

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff}   =-\frac{|\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})|}{4} (S^+S^{-}+ S^-S^{+})    
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent The CSCO of this Hamiltonian contains $H,S,S^z$. In the ground state $S$ is maximum thus $S=K/2$ and $S^z$ can take $2S+1=K+1$ values. Thus in the largest $S$ sector there are $K+1$ states. One can explore different states via a flux tuning mechanism. In the presence of the flux the Hamiltonian looks like
\begin{eqnarray}
H &=& -\frac{|\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})|}{2} S^2   +\frac{|\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})|}{2} \bigg(S^{z}-\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0} \bigg)^2 
\label{eq:flux_spectral}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Mapping with the degenerate ground state of stargraph}

\noindent Now we are going to discuss about the mapping of $K$ degenerate ground states of the parent $K-$channel stargraph model with the states of this flux-insterted all-to-all model obtained by removing inpurity-bath quantum fluctuations. In the stargraph model the K ground states is labeled by the $J^z$ eigenvalues. In the stargraph ground state $J=S-1/2$, where $S$ is maximum with value $S=K/2$. Thus there are $2J+1=K$ unique $J_z$ eigenvalues corresponding to the $J$ sector labeling different eigenstates. The gound state Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{gr}$ contains the $J^z$ states
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{H}_{gr}=\{\textcolor{blue}{-(K-1)/2,-(K-3)/2,\cdots , (K-3)/2,(K-1)/2}\} \nonumber\\
\label{eq:stargraph_states}
\end{eqnarray}

\par Now we shift our focus to the low energy Hamiltonian with flux shown in the eq.\eqref{eq:flux_spectral}. We can see that there is a unique ground state labeled by the $S^z$ eigenvalues. By tuning the flux ($\Phi/\Phi_0$) one can go from one ground state to another ground state or change the ground state. We can see that ground state energy is independent of the configuration of the impurity spin ($S_d^z=\pm 1/2$). Thus for each of those two possibilities we get two set of ground states labeled by the $S^z$ and the $J^z=S^z+S^z_d$. Similar to the stargraph case here also the ground state corresponds to the largest $S$ sector, $S=K/2$. Thus total number of $S^z$ eigenvalues are $2S+1=K+1$ taking values $\{ -K/2, -(K-2)/2, \cdots, (K-2)/2, K/2 \}$.

\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}
S_d^z &=& +1/2~,~ \{J^z\}=\{ \textcolor{blue}{-(K-1)/2, -(K-3)/2, \cdots, (K-1)/2}, (K+1)/2\} \nonumber\\
S_d^z &=& -1/2~,~ \{J^z\}=\{-(K+1)/2,\textcolor{blue}{ -(K-1)/2, \cdots, (K-3)/2, (K-1)/2 } \}
\label{eq:all_to_all_states}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}


\begin{figure}[!hb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{plt/stargraph-to-alltoall}
\caption{This figure shows the comparison and mapping between the stargraph degenerate ground states and the states of the quantum fluctuation resolved all to all model.}
\label{fig:stargraph-to-alltoall}
\end{figure}
Thus one can see that the ground state degeneracy of the stargraph model with different $J^z$ values gets lifted in the quantum fluctuation resolved all-to-all model. Depending on the value of the flux there is an unique ground state labeled by the $J^z$ value. Tuning the fluc one can go from one ground state to the other. This shows how one can explore different degenerate ground states of the parent stargraph model via the insertion of flux in the corresponding quantum fluctuation resolved all-to-all effective Hamiltonian.



\subsection{Local mott-liquid}
Impurity-bath quantum fluctuation resolved all-to-all effective Hamiltonian is written in terms of the spinor spin operators which are individually made out of two electronic degree of freedom. This is defined as $\vec{S}_i=\frac{\hbar}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{ \alpha,\beta\in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}}}  c_{0\alpha}^{(i)\dagger} \vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} c_{0\beta}^{(i)}$. In the above eq.\eqref{eq:all-to-all_1} we see the $U(1)$ symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian. Using the spinor repersentation one can see the spin creation operation in terms of the electronic degree of freedom is 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_i^+ &=& \frac{\hbar}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{\alpha,\beta\in \{\uparrow\downarrow\}} c_{0\alpha}^{(i)\dagger} {\sigma}^{+}_{\alpha\beta} c_{0\beta}^{(i)}
% = \frac{\hbar}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{\alpha,\beta\in \{\uparrow\downarrow\}} c_{0\alpha}^{(i)\dagger}   c_{0\beta}^{(i)} \delta_{\uparrow,\alpha} \delta_{\downarrow,\beta} 
=\frac{\hbar}{2} c_{0\uparrow}^{(i)\dagger} c_{0\downarrow}^{(i)}  \\
S_i^z &=& \frac{\hbar}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{\alpha,\beta\in \{\uparrow\downarrow\}} c_{0\alpha}^{(i)\dagger} {\sigma}^{z}_{\alpha\beta} c_{0\beta}^{(i)} =\frac{\hbar}{2} (c_{0\uparrow}^{(i)\dagger} c_{0\uparrow}^{(i)} - c_{0\downarrow}^{(i)\dagger} c_{0\downarrow}^{(i)} )~,~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
Thus this spinor spins are nothing but the Anderson pseudospin formulation in the spin channel. The spin creation opertor ($S_i^+$) shows simultaneous creation of an electron-hole pair at the realspace origin of the $i^{th}$ channel. The condensation of such electron-hole pais has already been shown in [CITE: mott]. Thus for this effective Hamiltonian one can define twist-translation oeprations to construct the gauge theory and unveiling any hidden degeneracy. Let's recall the effective Hamiltonian
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff} &=& \frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{4} \bigg[ \displaystyle\sum_{ij} S_i^+S_j^- ~+ \textrm{h.c.} \bigg]~,
\end{eqnarray}
where $i,j$ are the channel indices. Due to the all-to-all nature of the connectivity one can draw total $K!$ possible unique closed paths ($\mathcal{C}_{\mu}$) where each nodes (channels) is being touched only once. One can thus define total $K!$ number of translation operators ($\hat{T}_{\mu}$) which keeps the Hamiltonian invariant. Let's define one of such translation operator $\hat{T}_{\mu}$ thich gives a periodic shifts along the closed path $\mathcal{C}_{\mu}$. Let's define twist operator along the path $\mathcal{C}_{\mu}$
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} &=& \exp({i\frac{2\pi}{K} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ \mathcal{C}_{\mu}}}^{K} j S_j^z} )~,~~\hat{T}_{\mu}=e^{i\hat{P}^{cm}_{{\mu}}}
\end{eqnarray}
The  operation of the translation operator $\hat{T}_{\mu}$ is defined as $\hat{T}_{\mu} S_j^z = S_{j+1}^z$ where $j+1$ and $j$ are the nearest neighbor on the closed path $\mathcal{C}_{\mu}$. Then the braiding rule between the twist and translation operators are give as
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T}_{\mu}\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} \hat{T}^{\dagger}_{\mu} \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}^{\dagger}  &=&  \exp\{i[2\pi S_1^z-\frac{2\pi}{K}S^z]\} \nonumber\\
&=& \exp\{i[\pm \pi - \frac{2\pi}{K} S^z]\} =\exp(i\frac{2\pi p}{q})
\end{eqnarray}
The availability of the non-trivial braiding staatistics between these twist and translation operators is possible if $p\neq 0$ and $q\neq \infty$. Further simplification leads to the condition
\begin{eqnarray}
 \pm\pi -\frac{2\pi}{K} S^z = \frac{2\pi p}{q} ~~ &\Rightarrow & \pm\frac{1}{2}-\frac{S^z}{K} = \frac{p}{q} \nonumber\\
&& \frac{(\pm K-2S^z)}{2K} = \frac{p}{q}~,~
\end{eqnarray} 
$p,q$ are mutual prime, We knwo that the $S^z$ can take values $(\mp K/2\pm m)$ where $m$ is a integer $0 \leq m \leq K$. Putting this value in the above equation leads to two possible solutions.
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{(K-m)}{K} &=& \frac{p}{q} ~,~~ \frac{-m}{K}=\frac{p}{q}
\end{eqnarray}
For the first case $K-m=p$ we can see that $m=K$ makes $p$ trivial hus the allowed values are $m=0,\cdots,K-1$, which represents the corresponding $S^z$ eigen values 
\begin{eqnarray}
&&-K/2,-K/2+1,\cdots,K/2-2,K/2-1
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly the second case implies, $-m=p$, but $p=0$ is not allowed as this makes the braiding statistics trivial, thus the possible $S^z$ values are 
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\hspace{2.2cm} -K/2+1,-K/2+2,\cdots,K/2-1,K/2
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Thus we get the general braiding statistics between the twist and the translation 
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T}_{\mu}\hat{\mathcal{O}_{\mu}} \hat{T}^{\dagger}_{\mu}\hat{\mathcal{O}_{\mu}}^{\dagger} &=& e^{i\frac{2\pi p}{K}}
\end{eqnarray}
where $p$ corresponds to different $S^z$ states, related as $p=\pm K/2-S^z$. Thus we can see that there are $K$ possible $S^z$ plaleau states in the all-to-all model where each plateaux is $K$ fold degenerate. This $p/K$ is similar to the filling factor of the fractional quantum Hall effect. There are possibly $K!$ pairs of twist and translation operator corresponding to different closed paths $\mathcal{C}_{\mu}$ which can probe this degeneracy.

\subsubsection{Action on the Hamiltonian}
Now we findout the action of these twist operators on the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is written as 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{eff}&=& \frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{2} (S^{x2} +S^{y2})   
\end{eqnarray}
Due the all-to-all nature of the effetive Hamiltonian one can find $K!$ possible relative arrangement of those $K$ channels which keeps the Hamiltonian invariant. Here we briefly discuss the choice of the closed loop $\mathcal{C}_{\mu}$ and the insertion of the flux. As shown in the Fig.\ref{fig:stargraph-to-alltoall}(b) we have chosen a particular closed path which crosses all the outer spin only once. We embed that closed loop on a plane and put the flux perpendiculr to the plane through the closed loop. One can find a different closed loop where the ordering of the outer spins will be different. The action of the translation operator shifts the outer spins along this closed curve by one step.

The action of the twist operator on the $S^x$ is determined in the follwoing calculation
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{O}_{\mu} S^x \hat{O}^{\dagger}_{\mu} &=& \exp({i\frac{2\pi}{K} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ \mathcal{P}_{\mu}}}^{K} j S_j^z} ) ~~S^x ~~ \exp({-i\frac{2\pi}{K} \displaystyle\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ \mathcal{P}_{\mu}}}^{K} j S_j^z} )= e^{X} S^x e^{-X} \nonumber\\
%&=& S^x+[X,S^x] + \frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,S^x]] +\cdots  
%\end{eqnarray}
%For simplicity of thte calculation we define $i\frac{2\pi}{K}=\Omega$, thus $X=\Omega\sum_j jS^z_j$.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%&& [X,S^x] = [\Omega\sum_j jS^z_j,\sum_{l} S^x_l] =\Omega \sum_j j[S^z_j,S^x_j] = (i\Omega) \sum_j j S^y_j \nonumber\\
%&& [X,S^y] = [\Omega\sum_j jS^z_j,\sum_{l} S^y_l] =\Omega \sum_j j[S^z_j,S^y_j] = -(i\Omega) \sum_j j S^x_j  \nonumber\\
%&& [X,[X,S^x]] = [X,i\Omega \sum_j j S^y_j] = [\Omega\sum_{l}l S_l^z,i\Omega \sum_j j S^y_j] =i\Omega^2\sum_{l} l^2[ S_l^z, S^y_j] =-(i^2\Omega^2)\sum_{l} l^2 S_l^x ~,~~~~ \nonumber\\
%&& [X,[X,S^y]] = [X,-i\Omega \sum_j j S^x_j] = [\Omega\sum_{l}l S_l^z,-i\Omega \sum_j j S^x_j] =-i\Omega^2\sum_{l} l^2[ S_l^z, S^x_j] =-(i^2\Omega^2)\sum_{l} l^2 S_l^y ~,~~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\
%&& [X, [X,[X,S^x]]] = [\Omega\sum_j jS^z_j,-i^2\Omega^2 \sum_l l^2 S_l^x ]=-i^2\Omega^3 \sum_l l^3[S^z_l,S^x_l] =-(i^3\Omega^3) \sum_l l^3 S^y_l  \nonumber\\
%&& [X, [X,[X,S^y]]] = [\Omega\sum_j jS^z_j,-i^2\Omega^2 \sum_l l^2 S_l^y ]=-i^2\Omega^3 \sum_l l^3[S^z_l,S^y_l] =(i^3\Omega^3) \sum_l l^3 S^x_l 
%\end{eqnarray}
%Thus we get
%\begin{eqnarray}
%e^X S^x e^{-X}&=& S^x+[X,S^x] + \frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,S^x]] +\cdots  \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l S_l^x + (i\Omega)\sum_l l S^y_l + \frac{-(i\Omega)^2}{2!}\sum_{l} l^2 S_l^x + \frac{-(i\Omega)^3}{3!} \sum_l l^3 S_l^y+ \cdots \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l S_l^x \bigg[1-\frac{(il\Omega)^2}{2!}  +\cdots \bigg] + \sum_{l} S_l^y \bigg[ (il\Omega)- \frac{(il\Omega)^3}{3!} +\cdots \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l \bigg[ S^x_l \cos (il\Omega) +  S_l^y \sin(il\Omega) \bigg] =  \sum_l \bigg[ S^x_l \cos (-\frac{2\pi l}{K}) +  S_l^y \sin(-\frac{2\pi l}{K}) \bigg]  \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l ( S^x_l \cos \theta_l -  S_l^y \sin \theta_l ) ~,~~~\theta_l=\frac{2\pi l}{K}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%e^X S^y e^{-X}&=& S^y+[X,S^y] + \frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,S^y]] +\cdots  \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l S_l^y - (i\Omega)\sum_l l S^x_l + \frac{-(i\Omega)^2}{2!}\sum_{l} l^2 S_l^y + \frac{(i\Omega)^3}{3!} \sum_l l^3 S_l^x+ \cdots \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l S^y_l \bigg[ 1 -\frac{(il\Omega)^2}{2!} + \cdots \bigg]- \sum_l S^x_l \bigg[ (il\Omega) - \frac{(il\Omega)^3}{3!} +\cdots \bigg] \nonumber\\
%&=& \sum_l  (S^y_l \cos\theta_l  + S^x_l \sin\theta_l)
%\end{eqnarray}
%As already defined, $\theta_l=\frac{2\pi l}{K}=\frac{2\pi (K-n)}{K}$, where $n$ is an integer. We can see that in the large channel limit $\theta_l $ becomes inter multiple of $2\pi$. Thus in the large channel limit
%
%%\begin{eqnarray}
%%\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} S^{\nu} \hat{\mathcal{O}}^{\dagger}_{\mu} &\xRightarrow[]{K \rightarrow \infty } S^{\nu}~,~~\nu=x,y 
%%\end{eqnarray}
%
%\textbf{\textit{Fix this LaTeX issue (equation)}}

Thus in the large channel limit
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \lim_{K\rightarrow \infty}\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} H_{eff} \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}^{\dagger}\nonumber\\
 &=& \frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{2} \bigg[ \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} S^x \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}^{\dagger} \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} S^x \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}^{\dagger}  + \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} S^y \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}^{\dagger} \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} S^y \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}^{\dagger}  \bigg]\nonumber\\
&=&\frac{\beta_{\uparrow}(\alpha,\omega_{\uparrow})}{2} \bigg[  S^{x2}+S^{y2}  \bigg] = H_{eff} \nonumber\\
&&\lim_{K\rightarrow \infty } [\hat{\mathcal{O}},H_{eff}] = 0
\label{eq:hamiltonian_twisted}
\end{eqnarray}
 
\noindent The translation operator $\hat{T}_{\mu}=e^{i\hat{\mathcal{P}}_{\mu}}$ commutes with the Hamiltonian thus the generator $\hat{\mathcal{P}}_{\mu}$ also commutes with the Hamiltonian. We can label the $j^{th}$ state with the eigenvalues of this operator $\hat{\mathcal{P}_{\mu}}$ as $|p^{j}_{\mu}\rangle$. We here discuss the action of these twist and translation operators on these states.
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T}_{\mu} |p^j_{\mu} \rangle &=& e^{i\hat{\mathcal{P}}_{\mu}} |p^j_{\mu} \rangle = e^{ip^j_{\mu}} |p^j_{\mu}\rangle \nonumber\\
\hat{T}_{\mu} \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} |p^j_{\mu} \rangle &=&  \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} \hat{T}_{\mu} e^{i\frac{2\pi m}{K}} |p^j_{\mu}\rangle~~, \nonumber\\
&&~~\textrm{here $m$ signifies different $S^z$ plateaux.} \nonumber\\ \nonumber\\
&=& \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}   e^{i(\frac{2\pi m}{K}+p_{\mu}^j)} |p^j_{\mu}\rangle~,~~ \frac{2\pi m}{K} \equiv p_{\mu}^{m} \nonumber\\
\hat{T}_{\mu} \bigg( \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} |p^j_{\mu} \rangle  \bigg) &=& e^{i(p_{\mu}^{m}+p_{\mu}^j)} \bigg( \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu}    |p^j_{\mu}\rangle \bigg)    
\end{eqnarray}
Thus we can see that  $\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mu} |p^j_{\mu} \rangle $ is a state of the translation operator with different eigenvalue than $|p^j_{\mu} \rangle $, thus orthogonal to each other. Similarly one can generally show that $\langle p^j_{\mu} | \hat{\mathcal{O}}^{q}_{\mu} |p^j_{\mu} \rangle=0$, where $q$ is any integer. Also in the large $K$ limit we can see from the eq.\eqref{eq:hamiltonian_twisted} that these different twisted states has same energy. Which shows that at each plateau state labeled by the $S^z$ eigenvalue has $K$ fold degenerate eigenstates labeled by the eigenvalue of the translation operators. Thus the CSCO is formed by $H,S^z,\hat{T}$. Thus states can be labeled as  $|E,S^z_j,P^j_{\mu}\rangle$. 

\section{Topology and Gauge theory}




%\subsection{Gauge theory and Wilson Loops}
%
%%\subsection{Twist-translation operator}
%\noindent We define a translation operator $\hat{T}$ and twist operator $\hat{O}$ to describe the ground state manifold. The ground state manifold has $K$ fold degeneracy, labeled by the eigenvalue of the translation operator. The hamiltonain H commutes with the translation operator $[H,\hat{T}]=0$. We define the twist and tranlation operators in terms of an exponential of another operators as shown below.
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T}&=& e^{i\hat{P}} ~,~~\hat{O}=e^{i\hat{Q}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%We label the K degenerate eigenstates as $|p_i\rangle$ where $i\in [K]$ and the action of the translation operator on those states are given as 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T} |p_m\rangle &=& e^{ip_m}~,~\textrm{where $\hat{P} |p_m\rangle=p_m |p_m\rangle$}
%\end{eqnarray}
%Now we discuss the property of the twist operator. The twist operator takes one state $|p_m\rangle$ to the nearest state $|p_{m+1}\rangle$.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{O} |p_m\rangle &=& |p_{m+1}\rangle~. ~~\textrm{or very generally} \\
%\hat{O}^{n} |p_m\rangle &=& |p_{(m+n) \textrm{mod} K}\rangle~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Thus the above two equation seeks the wilson loop relation as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T}\hat{O}^{n} |p_{m}\rangle &=&  \hat{T} |p_{(m+n) \textrm{mod} K} \rangle = e^{i\gamma_{m,n}} |p_{(m+n) \textrm{mod} K} \rangle \\
%\hat{O}^{n} \hat{T} |p_{m}\rangle &=& \hat{O}^{n} e^{ip_m} |p_{m}\rangle = e^{ip_m} |p_{(m+n) \textrm{mod} K} \rangle 
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\gamma_{m,n}=p_{(m+n) \textrm{mod} K}+ (K-m)$. Thus we get the phase difference
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\langle p_{m} | \hat{T}^{\dagger} \hat{O}^{n \dagger} \hat{T}\hat{O}^{n} |p_{m}\rangle &=& e^{i[\gamma_{m,n}-p_{m}]} \equiv e^{i\frac{2n\pi}{K}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%
%Another way of finding out the structure of $\hat{O}$ is to use the BCH expansion. We know that for a two genral oeprators $X,Y$ we get 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%e^{X}Ye^{-X} &=& Y+[X,Y]+\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y]]+\frac{1}{3!}[X,[X,[X,Y]]]+ \cdots.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Using the above formula we can calculate
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T}\hat{O}^{n}\hat{T}^{\dagger} &=& e^{i\hat{P}} \hat{O}^{n} e^{-i\hat{P}} = \hat{O}^{n} e^{in\theta} \nonumber\\
%&=& \hat{O}^n + [i\hat{P},\hat{O}^n] + \frac{1}{2!} [i\hat{P},[i\hat{P},\hat{O}^n]] + \frac{1}{3!} [i\hat{P}, [i\hat{P},[i\hat{P},\hat{O}^n]]] + \cdots  \nonumber\\
%&=& \hat{O}^{n} \bigg[ 1+ (in\theta) + \frac{(in\theta)^2}{2!} + \frac{(in\theta)^3}{3!} + \cdots \bigg]
%\end{eqnarray}
%Assummption from the above equation is 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%[i\hat{P},\hat{O}^n] &=& i(n\theta) \hat{O}^{n} ~,~\textrm{which leads to }
%\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%[i\hat{P},[i\hat{P},\hat{O}^n]] &=&  [i\hat{P},\hat{O}^{n}] i(n\theta)  =\hat{O}^n (in\theta)^2
%\end{eqnarray}
%and so on. Thus the assumption is correct. Thus we get the commutation relation
%\begin{eqnarray}
%[ \hat{P},\hat{O}^n] &=& ( n\theta) \hat{O}^n 
%\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%[\hat{P},e^{in\hat{Q}}] &=& (n\theta) e^{in\hat{Q}}~,~\textrm{$\forall n$.}
%\end{eqnarray}
%%This implies,
%%\begin{eqnarray}
%%[\hat{P},e^{in\hat{Q}}] &=& [\hat{P},1+(in\hat{Q})+\frac{(in\hat{Q})^2}{2!}+\frac{(in\hat{Q})^3}{3!} +\cdots]  \nonumber\\
%%&=& [\hat{P},1]+  [\hat{P},(in\hat{Q})]+  [\hat{P},\frac{(in\hat{Q})^2}{2!}]+  [\hat{P},\frac{(in\hat{Q})^3}{3!} +\cdots] \nonumber\\
%%&=& (n\theta) \bigg[ 1+ (in\hat{Q}) + \frac{(in\hat{Q})^2}{2!} +\frac{(in\hat{Q})^3}{3!} +\cdots \bigg]
%%\end{eqnarray}
%%Above equation leads to a trial solustion 
%%\begin{eqnarray}
%%[\hat{P},(in\hat{Q})^r]=(n\theta) (in\hat{Q})^r~,~r=0,1,2,\cdots
%%\end{eqnarray}
%
%
%\noindent We are intrested in the simple case where $[\hat{P},\hat{Q}]=\hat{\Gamma} \neq 0$ and $[\hat{\Gamma},\hat{P}]=0=[\hat{\Gamma},\hat{Q}]$. In this case we get 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%e^{i\hat{P}} e^{i\hat{Q}} e^{-i\hat{P}} &=& e^{i\hat{Q}} e^{-[\hat{P},\hat{Q}]}
%\end{eqnarray}

%
%\subsection{LSM style calculation}
%
%\noindent In standard LSM style study and in it's various generalizations we usually define two operators, translation $\hat{T}$ and twist operator $\hat{O}$. We take the system and add a periodic boundary condition along one direction, let's say $\hat{x}$. Then we insert the gauge flux through that closed loop formed by the periodic $x-$direction. Let's for example take a spin problem shere each point along the $x-$axis there is a spin-1/2 object sitting. The Hamiltonian of that spin problem is $H_{lsm}$. By construction, this Hamiltonian has the translation symmetry along the $x-$direction. Thus this hamiltonian commutes with the translation operator along the $x-$direction denoted as $\hat{T}_x$, and the commutation reads $[\hat{T}_x,\hat{H}_{lsm}]=0$. Now we define the twist operator $\hat{O}$ as 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{O} &=& e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N_x} \displaystyle\sum_{\vec{r}} x S_{\vec{r}}^z }~.~
%\end{eqnarray}
%This twist operator inserts one full $2\pi$ flux into the system. In genral this full twist operator does not commutes with the Hamiltonian, we first study the commutation ralation.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%[\hat{H}_{lsm},\hat{O}] &\neq & 0
%\end{eqnarray}
%This commutation relation totally depends on the microscopic structure of the Hamiltonian $H_{slm}$. We can though study the commutation relation between this twist operator and the translation operator. This does not needs the microscopic knowledge of the Hamiltonian. This is assuming the fact that the spins are equally spaced along the $x-$direction and $xS^z_{\vec{r}}\equiv x\sum_{y} S^z_{(x,y)}$, where $\vec{r}=(x,y)$. In the general cases where the arrangement of the spin along the $x-$direction is non-trivial function of the $x-$coordinate, we can write the twist operator as 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{O} &=& e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N_x} \displaystyle\sum_{\vec{r}, x=1}^{N_x} f_x S_{\vec{r}}^z }~.~
%\end{eqnarray}
%Whatever be the general structure there should be translation invariance in the problem. The the brading rules between the twist and the translation operators for the simle case of problems where the spacings are uniform/trivial are given as 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T} \hat{O} \hat{T}^{\dagger} &=&  \hat{O}  \times e^{-\frac{2\pi}{N_x} S^z_{tot}} \times  e^{i 2\pi \sum_{y} S^z_{1,x}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%Sofar the calculations are in the operetor level, now we invoke the ground state property. We take the ground state value of the total magnetizaion $S^z_{tot}$. For the special case, where in the ground state $S^z_{tot}=0$, we get
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T} \hat{O} \hat{T}^{\dagger} &=&  \hat{O}    \times  e^{i 2\pi \sum_{y} S^z_{1,x}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%Now based on the value of $\sum_{y} S^z_{1,x}$ integer/half-integer we get trivial/non-trivial braiding rules between the twist and translation operators. We are interested in the non-trivial case here, which yields
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T} \hat{O} \hat{T}^{\dagger} &=&  \hat{O}    e^{\pm i\pi}
%\label{eq:TOTpOp_pi}
%\end{eqnarray}
%Now, let's assume that $|\psi_0\rangle$ is the ground state of the problem. Sofar, we have no idea about the nature of the gruond state and the excited states. As the translation operator is commuting, then the generator of this translation opertion $\hat{P}$ ($\hat{T}=e^{i\hat{P}}$) will also commute with the Hamiltonian.  Thus we can label the states with the eigenvalules of this operator $\hat{P}$.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\hat{T} |p_1\rangle &=& e^{ip_1} |p_1\rangle~,~
%\end{eqnarray}
%Now from the eq.\eqref{eq:TOTpOp_pi} we can check the action of the operator $\hat{O}$ on the ground state $|p_1\rangle \equiv |\psi_0\rangle$. We find that
%\begin{equation}
%\langle p_1| \hat{O}|p_1\rangle =0
%\end{equation}
%Thus $|p_1^{(1)}\rangle \equiv \hat{O} |p_1\rangle$ is orthogonal to the ground state $|p_1\rangle$. Now we need to find out the energy difference between $|p_1\rangle$ and $|p_1^{(1)}\rangle$. To calculate that we need to find out the expectation value
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Delta E &=&  \langle p_1^{(1)}| \hat{H}_{lsm}|p_1^{(1)}\rangle - \langle p_1| \hat{H}_{lsm}|p_1\rangle  \nonumber\\
%  &=&  \langle p_1 | \hat{O} \hat{H}_{lsm} \hat{O}^{\dagger} |p_1\rangle - \langle p_1| \hat{H}_{lsm}|p_1\rangle 
%\end{eqnarray}
%\noindent In the case where the twist operator commutes with the Hamiltonian $[\hat{H}_{lsm},\hat{O}]=0$, we will get $\Delta E=0$ in the operator level, independent of the system size. For the case $\Delta E=0$ we can say that ground state is doubly degenerate, labeled by the two eigen values of the momentum operator $0$ and $\pi$.
%
%\par But in the LSM case this twist operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian, thus in general $\Delta E\neq 0$. For this case we can see that the twisted state is an excited state. In special problem it can be shown that in the termodynamic limit this gap $\Delta E$ vanishes, showing either the double degenerate ground state (if one can show a gap above) or gapless spectrum.
%
%\subsubsection{Special case in fractional QHE}
%\noindent In the quantum hall problem, we can write down the Hamiltonian as 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%H_{qh} &=& \frac{1}{2m} \bigg[ \Pi_x^2 + \Pi_y^2\bigg]~,~  \textrm{where}~~ \vec{\Pi}=-i\hbar \vec{\nabla} + e\vec{A}
%\end{eqnarray}
%We know $[\Pi_x,\Pi_y]\neq 0$ thus the Hamiltonian also does not commutes with these operators individually. But one can define a pseudo-momentum $\tilde{\Pi}_{x/y}$ which commutes with the Hamiltonian in a particular gauge choice. For an example in Tao \& Haldane 1985, landau gauge was chosen $\vec{A}=(0,Bx,0)$. In this Landau gauge thepseudo momentum defined was ${\tilde{\Pi}}_x=p_x+eBy$ and ${\tilde{\Pi}}_y=p_y$. This pseudo-momentum operators commutes with the Hamiltonian and does not commutes with each other thus, following the algebra of $\hat{P}$ and $\hat{Q}$ as described in the above section. One can easily check that $[\tilde{\Pi}_x,\tilde{\Pi}_y]=i\hbar eB$.\\
%
%
%\par \textit{Question:} Now the question is, for a general Hamiltonian $H_{gen}$, if the ground state is multiply degeenrate (morethan one mutually orthogonal states with same minimum energy available). Can we always find out two operators $\hat{P},\hat{Q}$ such that $[\hat{H},\hat{P}]=[\hat{H},\hat{Q}]=0$ and $[\hat{P},\hat{Q}]\neq i\hbar c$, where $c$ is a constant.

\subsection{In our case of stargraph model}
\noindent In our model we find two string operators $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}=\sigma_d^z\Pi_{i=1}^{K} \sigma_i^z$ and $\hat{\mathbb{X}}=\sigma_d^x\Pi_{i=1}^{K} \sigma_i^x$, where $K$ is the number of channels. These two operators commutes with the Hamiltonian $H$ of this stargraph.
\begin{eqnarray}
[H,\hat{\mathbb{Z}}] &=& 0 = [H,\hat{\mathbb{X}}]
\end{eqnarray}

We can rewrite the operators in the form of a twist operator as,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{Z} &=& \sigma_d^z\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{K} \sigma_i^z = \frac{1}{i^{K+1}} e^{i\frac{\pi}{2} \sum_{i} \sigma^z_i}=e^{i\frac{\pi}{2} \sum_{i} (\sigma^z_i -1) } =e^{i\pi \sum_{i} (S^z_i -1/2) }
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly one can rewrite
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{X} &=& \sigma_d^x\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{K} \sigma_i^x =e^{i\pi \sum_{i} (S^x_i -1/2) }
\end{eqnarray}
The commutation between these two operators are given as
\begin{eqnarray}
[\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{X}] &=& \prod_{i=d,1}^{K} \sigma^z_{i} \prod_{i=d,1}^{K} \sigma^x_{i} \bigg[1-(-1)^{K+1}\bigg]
\end{eqnarray}
Thus we can see that for case where number of channels is odd that means $K+1$ is even, these two string operators commutes with each other forming a CSCO ($H,\hat{\mathbb{Z}},\hat{\mathbb{X}}$). On the other hand in the case where number of channels $K$ is even, these two operators does not commute with each other. Let's discuss these two cases seperately.
\subsubsection{$K=odd$} 
In the case where the number of channels $K$ is odd, we get $[\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{X}]=0$. Thus forming a CSCO with elements $H,\hat{\mathbb{Z}},\hat{\mathbb{X}}$. Thus one can label the states using the eigenvalues of these operators. For the case of $K=2n+1$ channels, the grounf state is $K$ fold degenerate and labeled by the eigenvalues of the operator $J^z$ which can take values $J^z=[-J,-J+1,\cdots, J-1, J]$, where $J=(K-1)/2$. For the odd channel case $J^z$ can take zero value. Thus 
\begin{eqnarray}
|J^z\rangle \equiv |Z,X \rangle
\end{eqnarray}
where the eigenvalue $Z$ can take $(K+1)/2$ values related to the absolute $|J^z|$ but cannot distinguish between $\pm J^z$ and $X$ can take two values $\pm 1$ which breaks the degenercy between $\pm J^z$. Thus these two operators together can uniquely label all the degenerate states.
% Note, the states $|Z=\rangle$

\subsection{Main}

\par We can define two operators, for convenience let's call translation and twist operator respectively, $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{O}$ defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T} &=& e^{i\frac{2\pi}{K} \hat{\Sigma}} ~,~\hat{O} = e^{i\hat{\phi}}~,~~\hat{\Sigma}=[\hat{J}^z-(K-1)/2]
\end{eqnarray}
One can see that the generators of these above operators commutes with the Hamiltoninan, $[H,J^x]=[H,J^z]=[H,J^z]=0$. In the large channel limit we can do semiclaassical approximation. As $J^x$ and $J^y$ both commutes with the Hamiltonian $H$ then $[H,J^y{(J^{x})}^{-1}]=0$, and any non-singular function of these operators must also commute with the Hamiltonian, thus we can say that
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\phi}=\tan^{-1}(\hat{J}^y(\hat{J}^x)^{-1})
\end{eqnarray}
Then we get $[\hat{\phi},\hat{H}]=0$. We can label the ground states by the eigen values of the translation operator $\hat{T}$. We can also use the ground states labeled by the eigenvalues of $J^z$ ($M$, say). Then the ground states are 
\begin{eqnarray}
|M_1\rangle,|M_2\rangle,|M_2\rangle,\cdots ,|M_K\rangle
\end{eqnarray}
Then the operations of the translation operators on this states are give below.
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T}|M_i\rangle &=& e^{i\frac{2\pi}{K} [M_i-(K-1)/2]} |M_i\rangle = e^{i2\pi\frac{p_i}{K} } |M_i\rangle~,~p_i\in[1,\cdots,K]
\end{eqnarray}
Now we check the braiding rule between the twist and the translation operators, we find
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T}\hat{O}\hat{T}^{\dagger}\hat{O}^{\dagger} &=& e^{\frac{2\pi }{K}[i\hat{\Sigma},i\hat{\phi}]}=e^{i\frac{2\pi }{K}} \nonumber\\
\hat{T}\hat{O}^m\hat{T}^{\dagger}\hat{O}^{\dagger m} &=& e^{\frac{2\pi }{K}[i\hat{\Sigma},im\hat{\phi}]}=e^{i2\pi \frac{m}{K}}
\end{eqnarray}

Next we shown that the states $\hat{O}^m |M_i\rangle$ are orthogonal to each other and with the state $|M_i\rangle$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T} \hat{O}^m |M_i\rangle &=& \hat{O}^m \hat{T} e^{i2\pi \frac{m}{K}} |M_i\rangle =\hat{O}^m e^{i \frac{2\pi(m+p_i)}{K} } |M_i\rangle \nonumber\\
\hat{T} \bigg(\hat{O}^m |M_i\rangle \bigg) &=&  e^{i \frac{2\pi(m+p_i)}{K} } \bigg( \hat{O}^m |M_i\rangle \bigg)
\end{eqnarray}
Thus different states $ \hat{O}^m |M_i\rangle$ for different $m$ are labeled by different eigenvalues of the translation operations, thus are orthogonal to each other. Now as the twist operator $\hat{O}$ commutes with the Hamiltonian, thus we can see that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle M_i| \hat{O}^{m \dagger}  H \hat{O}^m |M_i\rangle =\langle M_i|  H |M_i\rangle 
\end{eqnarray}
Thus the energy eigen values of all the orthogonal states are equal. Thus all the K mutually orthogonal states are degenerate.

\section{Duality in the MCK model}
We start from a strong coupling \((J \to \infty)\) spin-\(S\) impurity MCK Hamiltonian in the over-screened regime \(\left( K > 2S \right) \),
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{strong_ham}
	H(J) = \sum_{k,\sigma,l}\epsilon_{k,l} \hat n_{k\sigma,l} + J \vec{S_d}\cdot\vec{s}_\text{tot}~.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Here, \(\vec s_\text{tot}\) is the total spin \(\sum_l \sum_{kk^\prime \alpha\beta} \vec \sigma_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha,l}c_{k^\prime\beta,l}\) of all the zero modes. At strong-coupling, the ground states of the star graph eq.~\ref{stargraph} act as a good starting point for a perturbative expansion. As argued previously, there are \(K-2S+1\) ground states, labeled by the \(K\) values of the total spin angular momentum \(S^z = S_d^z + s_\text{tot}^z = -\frac{K}{2} + S, -\frac{K}{2} + S + 1, \ldots, \frac{K}{2} - S\). To leverage the large coupling, one can define a new spin impurity \(\mathbb{S}\) out of this ground state manifold. Since the degeneracy of a spin is given by its multiplicity \(2S^\prime + 1\), we have \(2S^\prime + 1 = K-2S+1 \implies S^\prime = \frac{K}{2} - S\). That is, the spin-\(S\) impurity has a dual described by a spin-\((K-2S+1)\) impurity. The states of this new spin are defined by
\begin{gather}
	\mathbb{S}_d^z \ket{S^z} = S^z \ket{S^z},\nonumber\\
	\mathbb{S}_d^\pm \ket{S^z} = \sqrt{S^\prime\left( S^\prime + 1 \right) - S^z\left( S^z \pm 1\right)} \ket{S^z \pm 1}
\end{gather}
The excited states of the star graph can be used to define bosons \cite{kroha_kolf_2007}, and the hopping into the lattice can then be re-written using these Bosons. One can then remove the single-particle hoping between the zero modes and the first sites using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation in the small coupling \(J^\prime = \gamma \frac{4t^2}{J}\), and generate an exchange-coupling between the new impurity \(\vec {\mathbb{S}}_d\) and the new zero modes formed out of the remaining sites in the lattice \cite{kroha_kolf_2007} (by remaining, we mean those real space sites that have not been consumed into forming the new spin). The new Hamiltonian, characterized by the small super-exchange  coupling \(J^\prime\), has the form
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	H^\prime(J^\prime) = \sum_{k,\sigma,l}\epsilon_{k,l} \hat n_{k\sigma,l} + J^\prime \vec{\mathbb{S}_d}\cdot\vec{s^\prime}_\text{tot}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The prime on \(s_\text{tot}\) indicates that it is formed by the new zero modes. This Hamiltonian is very similar to the one in eq.~\ref{strong_ham}, and that is the essence of the strong-weak duality: One can go from the over-screened strong coupling spin-\(S\) MCK model to another over-screened weak coupling spin-\((K-2S+1)\) MCK model. For the case of \(K=4S\), we have \(S^\prime = S\), and both \(S_d\) and \(\mathbb{S}_d\) describe the same spin objects (at least formally). The two models are then said to be self-dual. For example, for the case of spin-half MCK model, two-channel model is self-dual.
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{./duality.pdf}
	\caption{Duality of the RG flows as seen in the star graph Hamiltonian. The red and green circles represent the impurity and zeroth site spins respectively. At large \(J\), the red circle binds with the green circles to form an effective spin \(\frac{K-1}{2}\) object (yellow) that interacts with the remaining spin of the conduction bath (blue circles).}
	\label{duality_fig}
\end{figure}

One important consequence of the duality relationship between the two over-screened models is that the RG equations are also dual; while the strong coupling model has an irrelevant coupling \(J\) that flows down to the intermediate fixed point \(J^*\), the weak coupling model has a relevant coupling \(J^\prime\) that flows up to the same fixed point \({J^\prime}^* = J^*\). From the RG equation for the general spin-\(S\) MCK model, we know that \({J^\prime}^* = \frac{2}{K \rho^\prime}\), where \(\rho^\prime\) is the DOS for the bath of the weak coupling Hamiltonian. This constrains the form of the scaling factor \(\gamma\):
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	{J^\prime}^* = \frac{\gamma 4t^2}{J^*} = \frac{2}{K \rho^\prime} \implies \gamma = \frac{1}{4t^2} {J^*}^2 = \frac{1}{K^2 t^2 \rho \rho^\prime}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

There exists another set of cross-dual points in the MCK model. This was hinted at when we looked at the degree of compassion in eq.~\ref{gamma}. Since \(\Gamma\) depends only on the magnitude of \(\delta\), both \(\pm \delta\) will give the same degree of compensation, same ground state energy and same degeneracy \(\left(g^S_K = |\delta|+1\right)\). The definition of \(\delta\)gives the duality transformation as \(K \to 2S, S \to \frac{K}{2}\). The duality therefore exists between a spin-\(S\) impurity \(K-\)channel model and a spin-\(\frac{K}{2}\) impurity \(2S-\)channel model. The exactly-screened Hamiltonian \(K=2S\) maps on to itself and is therefore self-dual under this transformation.



\section{Impurity Quantum Phase transition in the MCK model}

\subsection{RG phase diagram under anisotropy}
\label{anisotropic_rg}
The isotropic MCK mode undergoes a phase transition when the symmetry of the channel interaction strengths is destroyed. We will now summarize the conclusions of this section. It will be shown analytically that if, in a \(K-\)channel model, one of the couplings becomes slightly larger than the other \(K-1\) couplings, the system goes into the singlet ground state characterized by local Fermi liquid excitations. On the other hand, if one of the couplings becomes slightly smaller than the rest, the system goes over to the \(K-1\) channel Kondo model. \textit{This shows that in the context of the general anisotropic MCK model, the symmetric model is highly unstable under slight anisotropy, and undergoes a phase transition into either the \(K-1\) channel NFL phase or into the single channel LFL phase} (see fig.~\ref{fig:-iqpt-pdf}).

To see the transition, we need to start with the more general anisotropic MCK model:
\begin{align}
	H = \sum_{k,\alpha,l}\epsilon_{k,l} \hat n_{k\alpha,l} + \sum_{kk^\prime,\atop{\alpha,\beta,l}}J_l \vec{S_d}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c_{k\alpha,l}^\dagger c_{k^\prime\beta, l}~.
\end{align}
We now consider the specific case where \(K-1\) channels have the same coupling \(J_1 = J_2 = ... = J_{K-1} = J_+\) and the remaining channel has a different coupling \(J_K = J_-\). The RG equations for such a model are
\begin{align}
	\frac{\Delta J_\pm}{|\Delta D|} = -\frac{J_\pm^2 \rho}{\mathcal{D}_\pm} + \frac{\rho^2 J_\pm}{2}\left[\frac{(K-1)J_+^2}{\mathcal{D}_+} + \frac{J_-^2}{\mathcal{D}_-}\right]
\end{align}
where \(\mathcal{D}_\pm = \omega - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{J_\pm}{4}\) are the denominators of the URG equations.
Setting \(J_+ = J_-\) leads to the critical fixed point at \(J_+^* = J_-^* = J_* = \frac{2}{K \rho}\). We now perturb around this fixed point by defining new variables \(j_\pm = J_\pm - J_*\). We also assume that the bandwidth is large enough so that \(\mathcal{D}_\pm \simeq \omega - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{J_*}{4} = -|\mathcal{D}_*|\). The RG equations then take the form
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
	\frac{\Delta j_+}{|\Delta D|} &= \frac{\rho J_+}{ |\mathcal{D}_*|}\left[J_+ - \frac{\rho}{2}\left[(K-1)J_+^2 + J_-^2\right]\right] = \frac{\rho J_+}{K J_*|\mathcal{D}_*|}\left[-\left(K - 2\right)J_*j_+ - (K-1)j_+^2 - j_-^2 - 2J_* j_-\right]\\
	\frac{\Delta j_-}{|\Delta D|} &= \frac{J_- \rho}{|\mathcal{D}_*|}\left[J_- - \frac{\rho}{2}\left[(K-1)J_+^2 + J_-^2\right]\right] = \frac{J_- \rho}{K J_*|\mathcal{D}_*|}\left[\left(K - 2\right)J_*j_-  - j_-^2 - (K-1)j_+^2 - 2(K-1)J_* j_+\right]\\
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
We will first look at the special case of \(K=2\), the two channel Kondo model. The equations simplify to
\begin{align}
	\frac{\Delta j_\pm}{|\Delta D|} = \frac{J_\pm \rho}{K J_*|\mathcal{D}_*|}\left[- \left(j_+^2 + j_-^2\right) - 2J_* j_\mp\right]
\end{align}
For \(j_- < 0, j_+ > 0\), we have \(\Delta j_- < 0\). The coupling \(J_-\) therefore becomes irrelevant. For small \(j_+\), we have \(j_+^2 < 2J_* |j_-|\)  and \(\Delta j_+ > 0\). This means that the isotropic fixed point is repulsive under anisotropy~\cite{Noz_blandin_1980}. The coupling \(j_+\) being relevant means we have a single-channel Kondo problem. We already know the non-perturbative URG equation for the single-channel Kondo problem~\cite{kondo_urg}, and it leads to the strong coupling fixed point~\cite{Noz_blandin_1980,fabrizio_nozieres_1995,mitchell_bulla_2014}.

We now look at the general \(K\) channel case. Let us first look at the regime \(j_- < 0, j_+ > 0\). In this regime, we have \(\Delta j_- < 0\), which means \(j_-\) will flow to larger negative values until it reaches \(j_- = -J_*\) such that \(J_- = J_* + j_- = 0\). \(j_+\) is, on the other hand, relevant for small values of \(j_\pm\). It will continue to grow until the numerator of \(\Delta j_+\) vanishes. This condition is given by
\begin{align}
	\left(K - 2\right)J_*j_+ + (K-1)j_+^2 + j_-^2 + 2J_* j_- = 0
\end{align}
Substituting \(j_- = -J_*\) gives the fixed-point equation \((K-1)j_+^2 + \left(K - 2\right)J_*j_+ - J_*^2 = 0\). Solving the equation gives
\begin{align}
	j_{+,*} = \frac{J_*}{2(K-1)}\left[-(K-2) \pm K\right] = \frac{J_*}{K-1}
\end{align}
At the final step, we chose the positive solution, because \(j_+\) is relevant in this regime. The new fixed point value of \(J_+\) is therefore
\begin{align}
	J_{+,*} = J_* + \frac{J_*}{K-1} = \frac{\frac{2}{K \rho} K}{K - 1} = \frac{2}{(K-1)\rho}
\end{align}
In other words, the \(K\) channel fixed point flows to the \(K-1\) channel fixed point. This is shown numerically in the left panel of fig.~\ref{K_to_K-1}.

\begin{figure*}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{../numerics/K to K-1.pdf}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{../numerics/irr_Jp_K=3.pdf}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{../numerics/irr_Jp_K=50.pdf}
	\caption{left panel: Flow of \(J_\pm\) when \(j_< 0\) and \(J_+\). The smaller coupling \(J_-\) is irrelevant and switches off, while the other \(K-1\) couplings \(J_+\) flow to the \(K-1\) MCK fixed point. Middle and right panels: Flow of the couplings \(J_+\) when \(j_+ < 0\) when \(j_- > 0, j_+ < 0\), for two values of \(K\). In both cases, the smaller coupling \(J_+\) eventually dies out, leading to only one surviving coupling \(J^-\) which is relevant, and we are left with a single-channel Kondo model.}
	\label{K_to_K-1}
\end{figure*}

In the opposite regime \(j_- > 0, j_+ < 0\), \(\Delta j_+\) is negative. It has been checked numerically that \(J_+\) ultimately flows to zero in this regime (middle and right panels of fig. \ref{K_to_K-1}), and \(J_-\) remains relevant. Since there is no numerator fixed point in the relevant coupling \(J_-\) and because all other couplings are irrelevant, the equation for \(J_-\) is replaced by the single-channel Kondo coupling URG equation, and the low-energy physics is then of strong coupling.

\subsection{Robustness of the degeneracy in the presence of channel anisotropy}

Here we start with the multi-channel zero mode model, any put anisotropy in the coupling $\alpha$. Let's start with a simple possibility where there are two coupling $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, where both the $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ are positive and negative. We write down the Hamiltonian corresponding to these cases,
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{an}&=& \alpha_1 \vec{S}_d.\vec{S}_1 + \alpha_2 \vec{S}_d.\vec{S}_2 %\\
%&=& \frac{\alpha_1}{2} (J_1^2-S_d^2-S_1^2) + \frac{\alpha_2}{2} (J_2^2-S_d^2-S_2^2)
\end{eqnarray}
%Now let's find out the CSCO for this above Hamiltonian. The operators which commutes with the Hamiltonian are $J_1,J_2,S_d,S_1,S_2$. Now can we choose the basis to be, 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%|J_1^z,S_1^z\rangle \otimes |S_d^z\rangle \otimes |J_2^z,S_2^z\rangle
%\end{eqnarray}
%In the ground state both the $S_1$ and $S_2$ will be maximum and $J_1$ and $J_2$ will be minimum. 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Term 1: $S_1=N_1/2$, where $N_1$ is the number of outer spin connected with the central spin with the coupling constant $J_1$. There are two possible $J_1$ values $J_1=(S_1+1/2)$ and $J_1=(S_1-1/2)$. In the ground state the being maximum $J_1=(S_1-1/2)$. Thus the energy contribution to the ground state from the the first term is 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%-\frac{\alpha_1(S_1+1)}{2}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%\item Term 2: Similar calculation show the contribution of the second term in the ground state energy is
%\begin{equation}
%-\frac{\alpha_2(S_2+1)}{2}
%\end{equation}
%Thus total ground state energy is 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%E_g  &=& -\frac{\alpha_1(S_1+1)}{2}-\frac{\alpha_2(S_2+1)}{2}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
%
%%In this ground state there are $2S_1$ number of $J_1^z$ eigen values with same energy contribution and similarly there are $2S_2$ number of $J_2^z$ states with same energy. Thus we can write down the ground state as 
%%\begin{eqnarray}
%%&& |J_1^z,S_1^z\rangle \otimes |S_d^z\rangle \otimes |J_2^z,S_2^z\rangle \nonumber\\
%%&=& |J_1,J_1^z\rangle \otimes |J_2,J_2^z\rangle
%%\end{eqnarray}
%
%
%One cna solve this problem in another way by rewriting the Hamiltonian as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%H=
%\end{eqnarray}
%
There are $K_1$ and $K_2$ numbers of outer spins respectivelty which are connected to the central spin with the coupling with $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$. Thus the total number of channels is $K=K_1+K_2$. When $\alpha_1=0, \alpha_2\neq 0$ then we end up with a multi-channel problem with $K_1$ number of channels thus the degeneracy becomes $K_1$ and for $\alpha_2=0, \alpha_1\neq 0$ the degneracy becomes $K_2$. Though this can be trivially verified from the above Hamiltonian, the important property of this problem is the robustness of the ground state degeneracy. As we vary $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, to study the ground state degeneracy. We find that for any values $\alpha_1$  and $\alpha_2$ such that $\alpha_1/\alpha_2\neq 0$ and $\alpha_2/\alpha_1\neq 0$ the ground state degeneracy remains constant at $K=K_1+K_2$. It is known in the literature [CITE someone] that under above mentioned anisotropy the low energy effective Hamiltonian becomes a multi-channel Kondo with smaller number of channels.

\subsection{Berry phase}

We start with the general multi-channel problem where the coupling strength with the central impurity spin of the $i^{th}$ channel is $\alpha_i$. Here our goal is to use the robustness of the ground state degeneracy of the star-graph model to build the gaue theoretic structure. We define the Hamiltonian of star-graph as 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{st}(\vec{\alpha}) &=& \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{K} \alpha_i \vec{S}_d.\vec{S}_i
\end{eqnarray}
We define the $K$-dimensional soupling space where one possible sonfiguration is denoted by the vector $\vec{\alpha}=\mathcal{N}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_K)$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the normalization factor, where $\alpha_i\neq 0$ and $\alpha_i\neq \infty $, $\forall i\in[K]$. The Schrodinger equation for the Hamiltonian reads as 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{st}(\vec{\alpha}) \Psi_{m} (\vec{\alpha}) = E_{m} (\vec{\alpha}) \Psi_{m} (\vec{\alpha})
\end{eqnarray}
Here, we are only interested in the ground state manifold, where the energy of the state is $E_{g}$. Due to the degeneracy ($K$-fold) there are $K$ states in that manifold with the same energy labeled by say $k$. Thus the equation for the ground state manifold reads
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{st}(\vec{\alpha}) \Psi^{k}_{g} (\vec{\alpha}) = E_{g} (\vec{\alpha}) \Psi^{k}_{g} (\vec{\alpha})
\end{eqnarray}
One can do a simple transformation to make the ground state energy zero. Thus
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{st}(\vec{\alpha}) \Psi^{k}_{g} (\vec{\alpha}) &=&  0 \nonumber\\
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(\vec{\alpha(t)}) }{\partial t} &=& H_{st}(\vec{\alpha(t)}) \Psi(\vec{\alpha(t)}) =0
\label{eq:hamiltonian_eq}
\end{eqnarray}
As the ground state is degenerate one can take any linera combinations of the states to create arbitrary basis state (orthogonal and normalized). Let's say $\psi_k(\vec{\alpha}(t))$ represents the arbitrary basis state, which should  be smooth in $t$ locally and follow the Schrodinger equation,
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{st}(\vec{\alpha}(t)) \psi_k(\vec{\alpha}(t)) &=&  0 
\end{eqnarray}
We here try to find the solution of the Eq.\eqref{eq:hamiltonian_eq}, we start with the trial solution 
\begin{eqnarray}
\eta_a(t) &=& U_{ab}(t) \psi_b(t)
\end{eqnarray}


\section{Conclusions}
In the URG analysis of the one dimensional Hubbard model \cite{1dhubjhep}, a study of the zero mode Hamiltonian (in that case, the Fermi surface itself) was sufficient to topologically characterize various phases of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) RG phase diagram.

\section{Hamiltonian RG of spin-\(S\) impurity MCK Model}
\label{appendix_urg}
The Hamiltonian for the channel-isotropic MCK model is given in eq.~\ref{mc_ham}. As mentioned in the same section, the Hamiltonian \(H_{(j-1)}\) of the \((j-1)^\text{th}\) RG step is obtained from the Hamiltonian \(H_{(j)}\) of the preceding RG step by applying a unitary transformation \(U_{(j)}\): \(H_{(j-1)} = U_{(j)} H_{(j)} U^\dagger_{(j)}\). The unitary transformation is obtained in terms of the fermionic operator \(\eta_{(j)}\):
\begin{gather}
	U_{(j)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left(1 + \eta_{(j)} - \eta_{(j)}^\dagger\right)~, \\
	\hat \omega_{(j)} = H_{(j-1)} - H^i_{(j)},~T_{(j)} \equiv \text{Tr}\left(H_{(j)}c_{j}\right)~,\\
	\eta^\dagger_{(j)} = \frac{1}{\hat \omega_{(j)} - \text{Tr}\left(H_{(j)} \hat n_{j}\right) } c^\dagger_{j} T_{(j)}~.
\end{gather}
The operator \(\hat \omega_{(j)}\) encodes the quantum fluctuation scales arising from the interplay of the kinetic energy terms and the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian.

The URG equation for the single-channel Kondo model \cite{kondo_urg} shows a stable strong-coupling fixed point. Ferromagnetic interactions are irrelevant. Strictly speaking, that RG equation already encodes, in principle, the multi-channel behaviour, through a modified \(\hat \omega\). To extract this information, we consider the strong-coupling fixed-point \(J \gg D\) as a fixed point and analyze its stability from the star graph perspective. For the exactly-screened case, the star graph decouples from the conduction bath, leaving behind a local Fermi liquid interaction on the first site. Similarly, in the under-screened regime, the ground state is composed of states where the impurity spin is only partially screened by the conduction channels. If a particular configuration of the bath-impurity system has the total conduction bath spin down, the impurity will have a residual up spin. This induces a ferromagnetic super-exchange coupling that is irrelevant under RG, so this fixed point is stable as well. 

We now come to the over-screened case, where there is a residual spin on the conduction channel site. The neighbouring electrons will now hop in with spins opposite to that of the impurity, so an antiferromagnetic interaction will be induced, and such an interaction is relevant under the RG. This shows that the over-screened regime cannot have a stable strong-coupling fixed point, and we need to search for an intermediate coupling fixed point. We therefore need the generator of the unitary transformation that incorporates third order scattering scatterings explicitly. We should take account of all possible processes that render the set of states \(\left\{\ket{\hat n_{q\beta}=1},\ket{\hat n_{q\beta}=0}\right\}\) diagonal. The higher order generator itself has two scattering processes, such that the entire renormalisation term \(c^\dagger_{q\beta} T \eta\) has in total three coherent processes. The complete generator upto third order can be written as
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\eta = \frac{1}{\hat \omega - H_D}T^\dagger c \simeq \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D}T^\dagger c + \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D}H_X \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c + \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} H_X
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where \(H_X = J \sum_{k,k^\prime < \Lambda_j, \alpha,\alpha^\prime}\vec{S_d}\cdot\vec{s}_{\alpha \alpha^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\) is scattering between the entangled electrons. There are two third order terms in the above equation corresponding to the two possible sequences in which the processes can occur while keeping the total renormalisation \(c^\dagger_{q\beta}T \eta\) diagonal in \(q\beta\). The second order processes remain unchanged. The total renormalisation takes the form:
\begin{equation}
	\label{full_ren}
	\Delta H_{(j)} = \underbrace{c^\dagger T \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c  + \left(c^\dagger \leftrightarrow c\right)}_{\Delta H^{(2)}_{(j)}} + \underbrace{c^\dagger T \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} H_X \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c + c^\dagger T \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} H_X + \left(c^\dagger \leftrightarrow c\right)}_{\Delta H^{(3)}_{(j)}}
\end{equation}
\(\Delta H^{(2)}_{(j)}\) and \(\Delta H^{(3)}_{(j)}\) are the renormalisation arising from the the second and third order processes respectively.

It is easier to see the RG flow of the couplings if we write the Hamiltonian in terms of the eigenstates of \(S_d^z\). These eigenstates are defined by \(S_d^z\ket{m_d} = m_d\ket{m_d}, m_d \in \left[-S, S\right]\). In terms of these eigenstates, the Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{H_spin_S}
	\mathcal{H} = \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_{k}\tau_{k\sigma} + \sum_{m_d=-S}^S \sum_{kl,\atop{\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow}} J^\sigma_{m_d} \ket{m_d}\bra{m_d} c^\dagger_{k \sigma}c_{l \sigma} + \sum_{kl} \sum_{m_d=-S}^{S-1} J^t_{m_d} \left(\ket{m_d+1}\bra{m_d} s^-_{kl}  + \text{h.c.}\right)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where \(k,l\) sum over the momentum states, \(\sigma\) sums over the spin indices, \(J^\sigma_m = \frac{1}{2} \sigma m J\) in the UV Hamiltonian, and \(J^t_{m} = J\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{S(S+1) - m(m+1)}\) is the coupling that connects \(\ket{m}\) and \(\ket{m+1}\). We first calculate \(\Delta H^{(2)}_{(j)}\). There will be two types of processes - those processes that start from an occupied state (particle sector) and those that start from a vacant state (hole sector). Due to particle hole symmetry of the Hamiltonian, they will be equal to each other and we will only calculate the particle sector contribution. 

In the particle sector, we have (\(\hat n_{q\beta}=1\)), so we will work at a negative energy  shell \(\epsilon_q = -D\). The renormalisation can schematically represented as \(H^I_0 \frac{1}{\omega - H^D_{q\beta}} H^I_1\). Both \(H^I_0\) and \(H^I_1\) have all three operators \(S_d^z, S_d^\pm\). We first consider specifically the case of spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) impurity. Those terms that have identical operators on both sides can be ignored because \({S_d^z}^2 = \text{constant}\) and \({S^\pm}^2 = 0\). All the six terms that \textit{will} renormalise the Hamiltonian have a spin flip operator on at least one side of the Greens function. This means that in the denominator of the Greens function, \(S_d^z\) and \(s^z_{qq}\) have to be anti-parallel in order to produce a non-zero result for that term. This means we can identically replace \(S_d^z s^z_{qq} = -\frac{1}{4}\). Also, in the particle sector, the Greens function always has \(c_{q\beta}\) in front of it, so \(\epsilon_q \tau_{q\beta} = \frac{D}{2}\). The upshot of all this is that the denominator of all scattering processes for the spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) impurity Hamiltonian will be \(\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}\).

We now come to the general case of spin-\(S\) impurity. The various terms that renormalise the Hamiltonian can be described in terms of the bath spin operators that come into them. For example, the term that has \(s^z\) on both sides of the intervening Greens function can be represented as \(z|z\). There are 7 such terms: \(z|z, \pm|\mp, z|\pm, \pm|z\). Each of these terms occur both in the particle and the hole sectors. We will demonstrate the calculation of two of these terms. The \(z|z\) \(+|-\) terms evaluate in the following manner.
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
	z|z: & \sum_{kk^\prime,m,\sigma} c^\dagger_{q \sigma} c_{k^\prime \sigma} \ket{m}\bra{m}\frac{{J^\sigma_m}^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{2}\sigma S_d^z}\ket{m}\bra{m} c^\dagger_{k \sigma}c_{q \sigma} = -\sum_{kk^\prime,m,\sigma}n_{q \sigma}\frac{{J^\sigma_m}^2 c^\dagger_{k \sigma}c_{k^\prime\sigma} \ket{m}\bra{m}}{\omega_{m, \sigma} - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{2}\sigma m}\\
	+|-: & \sum_{kk^\prime,m} c^\dagger_{q \uparrow} c_{k^\prime \downarrow} \ket{m}\bra{m+1}\frac{{J^t_m}^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{2}S_d^z}\ket{m+1}\bra{m} c^\dagger_{k \downarrow}c_{q \uparrow} = -n_{q \uparrow}\sum_{kk^\prime,m}\frac{{J^t_m}^2 c^\dagger_{k \downarrow}c_{k^\prime\downarrow} \ket{m}\bra{m}}{\omega_{m+1, \uparrow} - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{2}\left( m+1 \right) }
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
We similarly compute the rest of the terms. We again define \(\sum_q \hat n_{q\sigma} = n(D)\). To compare with the spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) RG equations, we will transform the general spin-\(S\) \(\omega\) to the spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) \( \omega\), using \(\omega_{m,\sigma} \to \omega - \frac{J}{2}\left(m\sigma - \frac{1}{2}\right)\).

The renormalisation in \(J^\sigma_m\) is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^\sigma_{m} = - n(D) \frac{\left( J^\sigma_m \right) ^2 + \left( J^t_{m-\frac{1+\sigma}{2}} \right) ^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}~.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Here, we have defined \(J^t_m = 0\) for \( |m| > S\). Two relations can be obtained from this RG equation, the RG equations for the sum and difference of the couplings: \(J^\pm_m = \frac{1}{2}\left(J^\uparrow_m \pm J^\downarrow_m\right) \). The RG equation for the sum of the couplings is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^+_m = -n(D)\frac{\sum_\sigma \left( J^\sigma_m \right) ^2 + \sum_\sigma \left( J^t_{m-\frac{1+\sigma}{2}} \right) ^2}{2\left(\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}\right)}\\
	= -n(D)\frac{J^2}{4}\frac{S(S+1)}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
This is an \(m-\)independent piece, so it can be summed over to produce an impurity-independent potential scattering term, which we ignore. 

The second is the RG equation for the difference of the couplings:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^-_m = -n(D)\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left( J^t_{m-1} \right) ^2 - \left(J^t_{m}\right) ^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}} = -\frac{1}{4}\frac{n(D) m J^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The usual \(J\) Kondo coupling is recovered through \(J = 2J^-_m/m\). Substituting this gives 
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta_\text{p sector} J = -\frac{1}{2}n(D)\frac{J^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

We can also obtain the RG equation for \(J\) from the transverse renormalisation:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^t_m &= - \frac{n(D)J^t_m \left( J^\downarrow_m + J^\uparrow_{m+1} \right) }{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{n(D)J^t_m J}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Since \(J^t_m \propto J\), we have
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J_\text{p sector} &= -\frac{1}{2}\frac{n(D)J^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The total renormalisation from both particle and hole sectors, at this order, is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^{(2)} &= -\frac{n(D)J^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

We now come to the third order renormalisation.
Following eq.~\ref{full_ren}, the next order renormalisation is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{psector_3rd_ren}
	\Delta H^{(3)}_j = c^\dagger T \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} H_X \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c \\
	+ c^\dagger T \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} T^\dagger c \frac{1}{\omega^\prime - H_D} H_X
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The first term will be of the form
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\sum_{q,k,l_1} c^\dagger_{q\beta, l_1}c_{k \alpha, l_1}\ket{m_1}\bra{m_2} \frac{1}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{\epsilon_k}{2} + \frac{\beta J}{4}S_d^z} \ket{m_2} c^\dagger_{k_1 \sigma_1, l_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2,l_2} \bra{m_3}\frac{1}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{\epsilon_k}{2} + \frac{\beta J}{4}S_d^z}\ket{m_3}\bra{m_4}c^\dagger_{k\alpha, l_1}c_{q\beta, l_1}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
We have not bothered to write all the summations and the couplings correctly, because we will only simplify the denominator here. Evaluating the inner products gives
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\sum_{qk,l_1} \frac{\ket{m_1}\bra{m_4}c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{k \alpha}c^\dagger_{k_1 \sigma_1, l_2}}{\omega_{m_2,\beta} - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{\epsilon_k}{2} + \frac{\beta J m_2}{4}}  \frac{c_{k_2 \sigma_2,l_2}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{q\beta}}{\omega_{m_3,\beta} - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{\epsilon_k}{2} + \frac{\beta J m_3}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
We again use \(\omega_{m,\sigma} \to \omega - \frac{J}{2}\left(m\sigma - \frac{1}{2}\right)\).
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\ket{m_1}\bra{m_4}c^\dagger_{k_1 \sigma_1, l_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2,l_2}\sum_{qk,l_1} \frac{\hat n_{q\beta}\left(1 - \hat n_{k\alpha}\right)}{\left(\omega - \frac{D}{2} - \frac{\epsilon_k}{2} + \frac{J}{4}\right)^2}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
We define \(\sum_q \hat n_{q\beta} = n(D)\). Performing the sums over \(k\) and \(l_1\) gives
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	-\frac{1}{2}\ket{m_1}\bra{m_4}c^\dagger_{k_1 \sigma_1, l_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2,l_2} \frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\(\rho\) is the density of states which we have taken to be constant. Reinstating the complete summation and the couplings gives
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{first_group}
	-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}\sum_{m_1,m_4,k_1,k_2,\atop{l_2,\sigma_1\sigma_2}}\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\lambda_{3}\ket{m_1}\bra{m_4}c^\dagger_{k_1 \sigma_1, l_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2,l_2}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
There is no sum over \(m_2\) and \(m_3\) because they are constrained by \(m_1\) and \(m_4\) respectively. \(\lambda_i\) represent the couplings present at the three interaction vertices. \(k_{1,2}\) sum over the momenta, \(\sigma_{1,2}\) sum over the spin indices and \(l_2\) sums over the channels.

The second term in eq.~\ref{psector_3rd_ren} can be evaluated in an almost identical fashion. The integral here be negative of the first term, because of an exchange in the scattering processes.
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\label{second_group}
	\frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}\sum_{m_1,m_4,k_1,k_2,\atop{l_2,\sigma_1\sigma_2}}\lambda_{1}\lambda_{3}\lambda_{2}\ket{m_1}\bra{m_4}c^\dagger_{k_1 \sigma_1, l_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2,l_2}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

The first group of terms (those that appear in \ref{first_group}) in the particle sector can be represented as \(a|b^\prime|c\), where \(a,b,c \in \left\{z,+,-\right\} \) and represent the operator for the conduction electrons in the three ceonnected processes. The \(\prime\) on \(b\) indicates that it is the state of the electrons \textit{not being decoupled}. The second group of terms (those that appear in \ref{second_group}) are therefore represented as \(a|b|c^\prime\), because in this group, the interaction \(H_X\) between the electrons that are not being decoupled occur at the very end.
We will only calculate the terms in the particle sector, the ones in hole sector will be equal to these because of particle-hole symmetry. The full list of terms is: 
$z|z^\prime|z\quad$
$z|z|z^\prime\quad$
$-|z^\prime|+\quad$
$-|+|z^\prime\quad$
$+|z^\prime|-\quad$
$+|-|z^\prime\quad$
$ z|+^\prime|z\quad$
$z|-^\prime|z\quad$
$+|+^\prime|-\quad$

$z|z|+^\prime\quad$
$z|z|-^\prime\quad$

$z|z|+^\prime\quad$
$z|z|-^\prime\quad$
$+|-|+^\prime\quad$
$+|-|-^\prime\quad$
$-|+|+^\prime\quad$
.

The total renormalisation in  \(J^\sigma_m\) is
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^\sigma_m = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}\left[\left( J^t_{m-1} \right)^2 J^\sigma_m + \left( J^t_m \right)^2 J^\sigma_m - \left( J^t_{m-1} \right)^2 J^\sigma_{m-1} - \left(J^t_m\right)^2 J^\sigma_{m+1} \right] = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}J^3 m \sigma
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Since we had defined \(J^\sigma_m \equiv \frac{1}{2}J m \sigma\), we have \(\Delta J = \frac{2}{m\sigma}\Delta J^\sigma_m\), and we get \(\Delta_\text{p sector} J = \frac{1}{4}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}J^3\).
Combining with the hole sector renormalisation, we get
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J^{(3)} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}J^3
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
The total renormalisation in \(J\) after combining all orders is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
	\Delta J = -\frac{n(D) J^2}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho n(D) K}{\omega - \frac{D}{2} + \frac{J}{4}}J^3
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
